throughout the years I have designed
high-end custom homes
crafting spatial poetics with vigas and latillas 
hand peeled by mojados 
whose sweat translates into profit for developers
working at a nifty rate
 
sometimes I go visit these homes
as they are being finished
 may I help you? 
I am asked by the realtor
standing at the door,
thinking that I may be the guy
who mixed the mud and pushed the wheelbarrow
 
I introduce myself as the designer
 oh, well, it’s so nice to meet you, what a wonderful job!please, come in. 
 
I was once asked by a home magazine journalist
if I felt insulted by such incidentswell, no, I said, my mind mixing for an answera good batch of cement is never accidental 
 
last year on my way up through Santa Fe
I made a detour and drove by a house of my design
the season’s first snow on the ground,
smoke rising out of the fireplace chimney
 
inch by inch
I know that house
through its X, Y, and Z axis
 
but, I cannot approach the front door
knock and expect to be invited in
to sit in the corner of my pleasing
and lounge around with the owner
as we sip on cups of hot herbal tea
making small talk about the weather
or discussing a reading
by the latest author come through
as the sun’s last light
streams in gallantly
through the window
just where I placed it
and for that reason
 
I take a handful of snow to my mouth
toss another into the air
my blessings upon the inhabitantsque Dios los bendiga y les dé más 
my grandfather would have said
 
I turn my car toward home
to my mother’s house
a place near and far to me
she, my mother, is bedridden
and my brother is the self-appointed caretaker
to bathe and feed her
bring her morsels of conversation
 
it is their own world now
 
ruled by a juxtaposition of understanding
against what I have come to know, now
here, so far and away
I am greeted at her front yard
by an old, propped up trunk hood
proclaiming my brother’s spray-painted inscription
         Jesus Saves 
on the opposite side it reads
         Keep Out! 
 I guess it just depends on what kind of day he’s having, 
someone once remarked
like a rattlesnake
it’s a fair warning
 
years ago I accepted this madness
and called it not my ownit’s better that he be drunk on Christ, said my motherthan on what he used to drink

When I stop to consider my calling, remark
the places a wayward temper impelled me
I’ve found in light of where I wandered lost
the most appalling evils could have befallen;
but when I disregard the journey it’s hard to
even fathom I endured so much affliction;
what’s more, my days being spent, I feel I’ve
seen my wariness go with them. I’ll come to
my end, for I surrendered artless to someone
with the science to dispel and destroy me if
so inclined, else the know-how to want to;
for if, with this very hand I could slaughter
myself, why—not on my account but because
so suited—would my enemy do otherwise?

It was the fruit I wanted, not the nest.
The nest was hanging like the richest fruit
against the sun. I took the nest
and with it came the heart, and in my hand
the kingdom and the queen, frail surfaces,
rested for a moment. Then the drones
awoke and did their painful business.
I let the city drop upon the stones.
It split to its deep palaces and combs.
It bled the insect gold,
the pupa queens like tiny eyes
wriggled from their sockets, and somewhere
the monarch cowered in a veil of wings
in passages through which at evening
the labourers had homed,
burdened with silence and the garden scents.
The secret heart was broken suddenly.
I, to whom the knowledge had been given,
who was not after knowledge but a fruit,
remember how a knot of pains
swelled my hand to a round nest;
blood throbbed in the hurt veins
as if an unseen swarm mined there.
The nest oozed bitter honey.
I swaddled my fat hand in cotton.
After a week pain gave it back to me
scarred and weakened like a shrivelled skin.
A second fruit is growing on the tree.
Identical—the droning in the leaves.
It ripens. I have another hand.

It’s the little towns I like  with their little mills making ratchets  and stanchions, elastic web,  spindles, you  name it. I like them in New England,  America, particularly-providing  bad jobs good enough to live on, to live in  families even: kindergarten,  church suppers, beach umbrellas ... The towns  are real, so fragile in their loneliness  a flood could come along  (and floods have) and cut them in two,  in half. There is no mayor,  the town council’s not prepared  for this, three of the four policemen  are stranded on their roofs ... and it doesn’t stop  raining. The mountain  is so thick with water parts of it just slide  down on the heifers—soggy, suicidal— in the pastures below. It rains, it rains  in these towns and, because  there’s no other way, your father gets in a rowboat  so he can go to work.

Not soon, as late as the approach of my ninetieth year,   
I felt a door opening in me and I entered   
the clarity of early morning.   
One after another my former lives were departing,   
like ships, together with their sorrow.   
And the countries, cities, gardens, the bays of seas   
assigned to my brush came closer,   
ready now to be described better than they were before.   
I was not separated from people,   
grief and pity joined us.   
We forget—I kept saying—that we are all children of the King.   
For where we come from there is no division   
into Yes and No, into is, was, and will be.   
We were miserable, we used no more than a hundredth part   
of the gift we received for our long journey.   
Moments from yesterday and from centuries ago—   
a sword blow, the painting of eyelashes before a mirror   
of polished metal, a lethal musket shot, a caravel   
staving its hull against a reef—they dwell in us,   
waiting for a fulfillment.   
I knew, always, that I would be a worker in the vineyard,   
as are all men and women living at the same time,   
whether they are aware of it or not.

Today we woke up to a revolution of snow,   
its white flag waving over everything,

the government buildings smothered,
schools and libraries buried, the post office lost   
under the noiseless drift,
the paths of trains softly blocked,
the world fallen under this falling.
In a while, I will put on some boots
and step out like someone walking in water,   
and the dog will porpoise through the drifts,   
and I will shake a laden branch
sending a cold shower down on us both.

what riot is afoot,
which small queen is about to be brought down.

Because the jobs were there
and a man could get rich
working on the line, the South
retreated North to Michigan,
whole families eating crackers and baloney
by the side of the road,
changing drivers to keep
moving through corn fields
and foreign towns,
sundown and darkness,
the moon a prophecy of chrome,
the stars 10 million headlights
of the cars they would build.
Ahead lay a city bright with steel;
behind, the dark fields folded
over everything they knew;
and when they dozed
on cramped back seats, they dreamed
such dreams as the road can make,
of drifting on a lake or stream
or lying down in hay to dream of traveling,
so that when they woke to a bump,
a couch, a voice saying, “It’s your turn,”
they were lost to themselves
and took a few moments
to remember their names.
Mostly behind their backs,
the locals called them
rednecks, crackers, goddamned rebs.
Strange to be strange,
in their new neighborhoods,
to be ethnic with a thick accent
and a taste for food the grocers didn’t stock—
hog jowl and blackeyes, turnip greens,
roasting ears, souse-meat—
the butcher shrugging,
the produce man shaking his head.
Sometimes their own voices
took them by surprise,
sounding odd and out of place
in the din of a city bus, ringing
lost in the evening air when
they called their children in for supper.
At work they touched
parts of tomorrow,
next year’s models always
taking shape and vanishing,
the present obsolete, the past
merely a rumor,

                    The Ungovernable
                ","
One thing I’m not doing in my poems: reporting
on anything that really happened.
 
When I say I’m from New York, Glaswegians say, “Oh, I love Woody
Allen.” They cannot construe how large a state can be. I just happen to
actually be from Manhattan.
 
How impractical, to imagine that a structure like a government would be
responsive to the needs of such a lot of people. Held like in a holding pen.
 
In the early 1990s I saw a yellow Indian drunk in a tattoo parlor in
Seattle. He literally said he could literally see right through me. If he said
it figuratively I took it literally.
 
A lot of people in America do not want regulation from the government.
In principle: our forefathers, our persecution. Ideally we wouldn’t need
industries and individual actions to be regulated. We wouldn’t even need
laws.
 
People, including people who run corporations or work for them, would
just behave responsibly. Corporations would take the responsibility of
personhood seriously.
 
My mother cannot be trusted to restrict me from buying R-rated
videogames at the porn store.
 
My mother struggled to love me—the firstborn had been so tractable—she
still struggles to love me—can she be commanded to love me? Now I see
what those commandments are about. There must be a God.
 
Objectively we could expect that our family members would go out of
their way to behave toward us with extra care, concern, and with love.
 
Sometimes there is a harsh disjunction between what objective perception
would suggest to us we might expect and what really takes place, or
“occurs,” within the framework of what we call “our lives.”
 
I really saw the other day for the first time that my mother did not
naturally take to me—I am not much like her. It would take an effort for
her to understand what matters to me. (Her love will come around.)
 
My own daughter is quite different from me—I think—it’s hard to tell, she
is only five years old. But she looks different—takes after her father, as I
took after mine—and so far her concerns are not my own. She loves pink.
I hate pink. (My love moves faster.)
 
Where would that moral activity come from, to behave responsibly
toward others? Not to overcharge, not to seek loopholes, not to dominate,
not to oppress. Does anyone consciously oppress? I guess some spousal
abuse comes from the pure urge to dominate, and the ire that results when
that domination is resisted, or thwarted . . .
 
But is it a pure urge or is it coming from an inscribed narrative of gendered
hierarchy? Like a man wearing a wife-beater has been told too many times
that his wife is supposed to listen to him and obey him. Now if he can be
told by the government that “My Strength Is Not for Hurting,” a local
billboard campaign, maybe that will ring in his ears when he lifts his fist.
 
If the government doesn’t do it, who will do it? The church used to do
it, and still does. The one time I went to church, with my mother, in
Tennessee, when we were at a family reunion and the whole family had
certain activities, and one of them was “church on Sunday,” I was brought
to tears by the simple goodness of the message that the pastor, or reverend
—minister?—this was a Methodist church—was preaching. It was Father’s
Day, actually, and he talked about how fathers ought to make sure to
spend time with their kids. Turn off the TV, he said, and spend some
time with your kids.
 
I was crying because I am not used to an experience of shared instruction
in goodness. It was very moving to be in a room with real people all
receiving the same instruction.

The birds against the April wind
 Flew northward, singing as they flew;They sang, “The land we leave behind
 Has swords for corn-blades, blood for dew.”“O wild-birds, flying from the South,
 What saw and heard ye, gazing down?”“We saw the mortar’s upturned mouth,
 The sickened camp, the blazing town!“Beneath the bivouac’s starry lamps,
 We saw your march-worn children die;In shrouds of moss, in cypress swamps,
 We saw your dead uncoffined lie.“We heard the starving prisoner’s sighs
 And saw, from line and trench, your sonsFollow our flight with home-sick eyes
 Beyond the battery’s smoking guns.”“And heard and saw ye only wrong
 And pain,” I cried, “O wing-worn flocks?”“We heard,” they sang, “the freedman’s song,
 The crash of Slavery’s broken locks!“We saw from new, uprising States
 The treason-nursing mischief spurned,As, crowding Freedom’s ample gates,
 The long-estranged and lost returned.“O’er dusky faces, seamed and old,
 And hands horn-hard with unpaid toil,With hope in every rustling fold,
 We saw your star-dropt flag uncoil.“And struggling up through sounds accursed,
 A grateful murmur clomb the air;A whisper scarcely heard at first,
 It filled the listening heavens with prayer.“And sweet and far, as from a star,
 Replied a voice which shall not cease,Till, drowning all the noise of war,
 It sings the blessed song of peace!”So to me, in a doubtful day
 Of chill and slowly greening spring,Low stooping from the cloudy gray,
 The wild-birds sang or seemed to sing.They vanished in the misty air,
 The song went with them in their flight;But lo! they left the sunset fair,
 And in the evening there was light.

I was a little boy, at home with strangers.   
I liked my playmates, and knew well,   
Whence all their parents came;
From England, Scotland, royal France   
From Germany and oft by chance
The humble Emerald Isle.
But my brown skin and close-curled hair
Was alien, and how it grew, none knew;
Few tried to say, some dropped a wonderful word or stray;
Some laughed and stared.
And then it came: I dreamed.   
I placed together all I knew
All hints and slurs together drew.   
I dreamed.
I made one picture of what nothing seemed   
I shuddered in dumb terror
In silence screamed,
For now it seemed this I had dreamed;
How up from Hell, a land had leaped
A wretched land, all scorched and seamed   
Covered with ashes, chained with pain   
Streaming with blood, in horror lain   
Its very air a shriek of death
And agony of hurt.
Anon I woke, but in one corner of my soul   
I stayed asleep.
Forget I could not,
But never would I remember   
That hell-hoist ghost   
Of slavery and woe.
I lived and grew, I worked and hoped
I planned and wandered, gripped and coped   
With every doubt but one that slept   
Yet clamoured to awaken.
I became old; old, worn and gray;   
Along my hard and weary way
Rolled war and pestilence, war again;   
I looked on Poverty and foul Disease   
I walked with Death and yet I knew
There stirred a doubt: Were all dreams true?   
And what in truth was Africa?
One cloud-swept day a Seer appeared,   
All closed and veiled as me he hailed
And bid me make three journeys to the world   
Seeking all through their lengthened links   
The endless Riddle of the Sphinx.
I went to Moscow; Ignorance grown wise taught me Wisdom;
I went to Peking: Poverty grown rich
Showed me the wealth of Work
I came to Accra.
Here at last, I looked back on my Dream;   
I heard the Voice that loosed
The Long-looked dungeons of my soul
I sensed that Africa had come
Not up from Hell, but from the sum of Heaven’s glory.
I lifted up mine eyes to Ghana
And swept the hills with high Hosanna;
Above the sun my sight took flight   
Till from that pinnacle of light
I saw dropped down this earth of crimson, green and gold
Roaring with color, drums and song.
Happy with dreams and deeds worth more than doing   
Around me velvet faces loomed   
Burnt by the kiss of everlasting suns
Under great stars of midnight glory   
Trees danced, and foliage sang;
The lilies hallelujah rang
Where robed with rule on Golden Stool   
The gold-crowned Priests with duty done   
Pour high libations to the sun
And danced to gods.
Red blood flowed rare ’neath close-clung hair   
While subtle perfume filled the air   
And whirls and whirls of tiny curls   
Crowned heads.
Yet Ghana shows its might and power   
Not in its color nor its flower   
But in its wondrous breadth of soul   
Its Joy of Life
Its selfless role
Of giving.
School and clinic, home and hall   
Road and garden bloom and call   
Socialism blossoms bold
On Communism centuries old.
I lifted my last voice and cried   
I cried to heaven as I died:
O turn me to the Golden Horde   
Summon all western nations   
Toward the Rising Sun.
From reeking West whose day is done,   
Who stink and stagger in their dung   
Toward Africa, China, India’s strand   
Where Kenya and Himalaya stand   
And Nile and Yang-tze roll:
Turn every yearning face of man.
Come with us, dark America:
The scum of Europe battened here   
And drowned a dream
Made fetid swamp a refuge seem:
Enslaved the Black and killed the Red   
And armed the Rich to loot the Dead;   
Worshipped the whores of Hollywood   
Where once the Virgin Mary stood
And lynched the Christ.
Awake, awake, O sleeping world   
Honor the sun;
Worship the stars, those vaster suns   
Who rule the night
Where black is bright
And all unselfish work is right

“Well, goddamnit, Lawson! Whyn’t you play in key and keep to the
rhythm? First you say you wanna go back to Fresno, back to the fish store
and Kamaboko Gardens on the West Side, and then you say, forget it, I
take it back, let’s go to the Sacto Bon-Odori instead.”
“Yeah. And this ain’t even shoyu season yet, chump!”
“Awww, hell. What’s wrong with you two? Can’t you improvise? You
know, I’m just laying down a bass, man. Just a rhythm, a scale,
something to jam on, something to change, find our range, something to
get us going. Once we get started, we can work our way around to Weed,
put on some tire chains, or break down in Selma, refuse to buy grapes,
raisins, or Gallo, do a pit-stop at a Sacto sporting goods, pick up some air
mattresses shaped like pearl-diving women, and float all day downriver to
the deltas, sipping Cokes and saké in the summer heat.”
“Shit. Whyn’t you just solo and forget the rest of us? You start chanting
and pretty soon we’re hearing the entire Lotus Sutra.”
“You two Buddhaheads just a pair of one-eyed Japs with dishpan hands
and deadpan minds, man. This is the Champ Chonk talking, and we’re
playing Chinese anaconda. Eight-card, no-peek pak-kai, roll your own,
hi-lo, three for sweep, four for hot-sour soup stud, and neither of you’s
put down your ante yet. So shit or get off the shu-mai, fellas.”
“Calm down and watch the road, Alan.”
“Who’s driving this heap, anyway?”
“I thought you were.”
“I thought Lawson was.”
“Don’t worry. This is a dodo-driven, autopiloted, cruise-controlled, Triple-
A-mapped, Flying-A-gassed, dual-overhead-cam, Super-Sofistifunktified,
Frijole Guacamole, Gardena Guahuanco, Chonk Chalupa Cruiser with
Buddha Bandit Bumpers, Jack!”
“Where we going, Alan?”
“Where do you think? We’re going to Paradise.”
IV.On the Road to Paradise
Distances don’t matter
nor the roll of the road past walnut groves.
It’s sky that counts,
the color of it at dawn or sunset,
a match more true to the peach
than a mix of oils by Matisse.
Or maybe it’s actually the weather
we love most, the way it shifts
and scatters over the state
like radio waves bouncing off the face of the moon.
The one over there, near Yuba City,
rising over a backyard garden
of onions, tomatoes, squash, and corn.
The one with the spider
scrambling through celery,
harvesting moths and mayflies
from the web it has strung between stalks.
Sometimes I wish I could harvest the weather,
reap it like wheat or rice,
store it in a silo
announcing steady rain or clear skies on its sides.
When the prices rise,
I could ship hailstorms or Santanas in orange crates,
make Safeway go broke,
do something politically efficacious for a change.
But all I really do besides write these poems
is allow my mind to wander while I drive.
There it goes, down the arroyo,
through manzanita and Mormon tea.
Or there, up the mustard and Indian pipe on the hill.
Might as well let it.
Nothing but God and Country on the radio now.
Wolfman Jack’s syndicated and the Dodgers
haven’t made it to Vero Beach.
I wish this road would turn or bend,
intersect with a spy movie some Spanish galleon,
or maybe a Chinese poem with landscapes
in brocade, mist, wine, and moonlight.
This California moon is yellow most of the time,
like it was stained with nicotine,
or sealed in amber like an insect.
Why is it always better somewhere else?
Why do I always wish I were Tu Fu?
V.Palmistry Fantasia 
There, the pasteboard and neon hand!
Just past the interchange by the bowling alley.
The one with silver rockets, small green stars,
and a trail of red comets flashing through the smog.
It’s still here, the hand
held up in greeting or command.
“Halt!” it says, or
“Peace be with you, brother,”
while the map across its palm
traces excursions into blue trees,
green skies, and mushroom-colored lives.
Blue dun is the color of its neon,
the same as the throat feathers of a teal
scudding over the marshes of Merced.
It matches the purple mascara the gypsy woman wears,
matches the pools of velvet-blue darkness in her eyes.
Her name is Alma Josephina,
and she designed the sign herself,
imitating the figure of her own hand,
the neon indicative of its natural aura.
That was twenty years ago
when Eisenhower was President
and all her customers wore pedal pushers
or Bermudas, and never noticed
the fireflies in the marshes at night.
                           *
You’re Oriental, aren’t you?
Can you read tea leaves?
I tried to once, years ago,
had a Chinese woman teaching me,
but her fees were too steep.
I like a joke.
It loosens up the customers.
Well, come here towards the light.
Let me get a good look
at the ghosts in the grave of your palm.
They’re there, you know.
All the people you’ve ever been,
all the trips you’ve taken
and the towns you’ve settled in,
back before the birth of Christ,
back before people were people,
before this paw was a hand.
You see?   The whole palm glows
like purple mist over a cemetery.
Move closer.   Clamp it around the glass.
See it flare on the inside?
That’s the light your bones make,
not the crystal at all.
Look at your hand now.
You can see yourself dancing
on the heel just above the wrist.
You must be a happy man.
You’ll be born again and again,
get to the threshold of Heaven,
never enter but keep coming back,
here, for fun, for friends,
until this will be Paradise,
and Paradise just an old resort
the highway’s passed by.
Well, have a nice trip.
You’ll make it yet.
Says so right in that curvy line
around the Mound of Venus,
that thumbstump there,
right where the long straight line
cuts across like an interstate.
VI.Postcards Sent Home
1.   
Dust rolls out of the hills like fog,
and it’s too hot for shoes or shirts.
I’d like to take my hair off too,
peel it from my head, dip it in a bucket of ice,
and wear it around my neck like a bandana.

VII.Body & Fender/Body & Soul
At the grill, the Indian girl with buckteeth and dimples serves us a round
of coffee and sweet rolls. We’re waiting for the guy at Henley’s Texaco,
down the street, to find us a fan belt that’ll fit.   It’s early, the sky’s still in
the john, shaving, and the sports page has to wait to get in. Everybody’s
grumpy. We sit around, jab at raisins with our forks, and try to look as
tough as the waitresss.
                           Her name’s Rita. Her brothers jump fires and pump
oil in Alaska. Her sisters string beads and make babies back on the Res.
Her ex is white, a logger who threatened never to come back and didn’t.
She doesn’t hold any grudges. That’s why she’s so nice, why she pops her
gum filling the salt and pepper shakers, why she adjusts her girdle so we
can see, why the egg spot on her dress doesn’t show.
                                             
                                             Outside, the sun eases up over
the parking lot, scrambles across the freeway, and runs for cover behind a
pile of pumpkin-colored clouds. 99 starts shuffling its deck of cars and
pickups, getting set to deal a hand of nine-to-five stud. We don’t watch.   
This is Redding, and ain’t nothing thing going on besides the day shift.
                                             Alan says, “Look, there’s Venus,” and
points to a piece of light draining the sky. I want to order a country-
fried steak, talk about the Dodgers, but there isn’t time. Lawson hums a
few chords, stirring the changes with his coffee spoon.
                                    
                                                               Rita cruises back like
a bus bound for Reno, starts dealing some ashtrays. She says, “How’s it
going boys?”
               I answer for all of us—“Hey, Rita. It’s almost gone.”
VIII.Pilgrimage to the Shrine
Six hours since
the Paradise Cutoff
and running on empty.
No gas stations or rest stops,
no weigh station, no cops.
Just miles of straight road
and a long double-yellow
unrolling in front of us.
Alan recognized nothing.
Lawson pops the glove,
pulls out a penlight,
and fingers the map,
pronouncing a few mantras.
Our headlights slide
over a scarecrow
made of tumbleweeds
standing by the road.
He’s wearing a kimono,
a dark-blue stovepipe hat,
his shoulders cloaked
in a wreath of chrysanthemums.
We pull over,
back up,
and he disappears
into the pale-
grey darkness.
It’s smoke.
We can smell it,
so somebody’s
got to be
close by.
But our eyes
go blined, fill
with tears and ashes
as we stumble
down the off-ramp.
The smell of
frying trout
and steamed rice
reaches us when
we come to.
An old hermit,
dressed like the scarecrow,
crawls out of his barracks
and brings us tea.
“Drink!” he says,
“It’ll pick you up!”
And so we drink,
feeling drugged.
Soft blues
in the key
of sleep
suffocates the air.
From up the mountain,
the sound of obsidian,
flaking in the wind.
Clouds of black glass
waltz around us.
We dress ourselves
in shrouds of tule reeds
stitched with barbed wire,
stained with salt and mud.
We refuse to cry.
We drift back
to the highway,
holding our fists
like rattles,
shaking them
like bones.
IX.Confessions of the Highway/The Hermit Speaks
I know the rituals, the spells of grapes,
the ceremonies of tomatoes, celery, and rice.
I know the color of wind dressed for fiesta,
and the names of carnivals in Spanish and Japanese.
I am familiar with the determination of campesinos
who migrate up and down the stretch of the state
in search of crops ready for harvest.
It’s all a dull ache in my back,
small cuts on the throats of my fingers,
and the alkali of a dry lake in my lungs.
For me, the oracle of the giant orange
always predicts good fortune,
yet, it never comes true.
My stomach is full of sand and tar,
a little bit of paint, a few crickets.
I stand in swampwater up to my hips,
and the stink of rotting figs
escapes my armpits in small brown clouds.
Scrub oak and tumbleweed sprout from my scalp,
make a small grove behind my left ear.
I don’t know why sparrows and starlings
refuse to approach me, to take the grass seed
tucked in the cuffs of my trousers.
Maybe it’s the stain of asphalt around my ankles,
this copper sheen of sweat on my back.
Sometimes, when the valley heat
makes the bones in my feet
start to hiss and burn,
the desire to escape comes over me again.
I can’t help it.
My arms pull down a few telephone posts,
my shoulders churn against the bindings.
I feel myself wanting to sit up,
begin to walk again, and thresh my way
across rice fields and acres of alfalfa.
For once I’d like to lift my face
straight above Shasta into the sky,
shout in unison with thunder,
roar with the assurance of Santana wind,
leap out of these bonds of copper and steel,
slough off this skin of cement,
and walk south or north or even west
into the weather and the sea.

So won a name in this place,   handing off lath strips to a hammer's   measure, seeing the passing girls' slits   in roils of timber grain. Mountains, barley, scaffold,   dirt. I was sixteen. And hourly   from the hoods of faraway bells   monks emerging like hairless animals. I was sixteen.

In Tunis we try to discuss divorce
And dying but give up to lounge
With rug merchants under a plum tree.
From its corner the lamb’s severed head
Watches the flies drink from its eyes
And its fat disappear into the fire.
The light rinses the edge of your sandal,
The two wasps that ornament the blur
Of screened window. My grandmother
Would have loved a night like this.
In the wind chimes I can hear her tea cart
With its china rolling through Cook Street’s
Stony yard one summer when I was always
Thirsty, and she moved like a figure
On a clock from my lawn chair to the cart,
Or swabbed me with alcohol, or cut
My hair with the straight razor.
I was a week out of the hospital.
Beneath my breasts an incision was crossed
With stitches of surgical thread.
The scalpel came so close it gave
My heart a quick kiss. I nearly died.
Years later I can still see the skin
Flutter on the inside of my left breast
And my heart limps like a great uncle
Who, because he was a Jew and lame,
Was dragged by cossacks across the steppes.

Of a horse who ran so hard, so perfectly
Hard, that the green grass rose to meet him.

My objectives this morning were vague.
As always I'd hike these hills—
a way to keep going
against the odds age deals,
a way to keep body and soul
together, and not so much thinking
as letting things steal into mind—
but I started counting
from the very first step I took.
I wore rank old boots, ill-laced,
and patchwork pants.
Around my neck hung the frayed
lanyard of a whistle I use
to summon our trio of dogs,
who capered and yelped their pleasure
at one of our walks,
and more miraculous still,
at having me for a master.
It's true in a sense
that I always count as I wander,
though it's usually the beats of a tune
(Thelonious's ""Blue Monk""
a favorite) that mark my time.
These counts felt odder,
better. We scattered a brood
of grouse at step 91.
The deerflies strafed us.
At 500 a late trillium
glowed by a ledge like a lotus.
Right along the rain kept pounding.
I was mindful of all these things
but I never stopped counting.
Life was good, and more.
It was worthy of better response.
At 1000 I thought,Enough—and counted on.
Nothing was coming to mind.
Nothing is coming again
from my hike half the day ago
with three dogs through rain
but a mystic sense of well-being
in quietly chanted numbers.
Whatever this trance,
I treasured it as a wonder
not to be wrenched into meaning,
as in Every second counts,
as in You should count your blessings,
though of those there seems no doubt.

My first week in Cambridge a car full of white boys
tried to run me off the road, and spit through the window,
open to ask directions. I was always asking directions
and always driving: to an Armenian market
in Watertown to buy figs and string cheese, apricots,
dark spices and olives from barrels, tubes of paste
with unreadable Arabic labels. I ate
stuffed grape leaves and watched my lips swell in the mirror.
The floors of my apartment would never come clean.
Whenever I saw other colored people
in bookshops, or museums, or cafeterias, I’d gasp,
smile shyly, but they’d disappear before I spoke.
What would I have said to them? Come with me? Take
me home? Are you my mother? No. I sat alone

And to keep out the cold I’ve bought a cloak, And every day a cigar I’ll smoke,     All to follow my own dear true     Love of a Kangaroo!’     V Said the Kangaroo, ‘I’m ready!     All in the moonlight pale; But to balance me well, dear Duck, sit steady!

          The way to the toy store was blocked by a fallen tree
in the road. There was a policeman directing traffic down a

in the night.” I took the turn and drove down the street
looking for a way to turn back. Other streets were blocked by
fallen trees, and I couldn’t find a way back to the toy store.
I kept driving and soon I was on the outskirts of town. I
got on a highway and drove, soon forgetting the toy store and
what I was supposed to get there. I drove on as if I was hypno-
tized, not noticing the signs for turnoffs. I must have driven
a couple of hours before I woke up, then I took the next exit
and had no idea where I was. I drove down a straight tree-lined
lane with farm houses on either side. There was a lake at the
end of the lane. I pulled over and parked. I got out and
started walking. There were several docks along the shore.
I walked out on one and watched the ducks swimming and diving.
There was something bobbing in the middle of the lake. I stared
at it for a long time before I realized it was a man’s head.
Then, a moment later, it was a coconut. No, it was an old tire
floating right side up. I gave up and started following the
ducks. They would suddenly fly up and circle the lake and
come down and splash land again. It was quite entertaining.
A man walked up behind me and said, “This government lake is
off-limits to the public. You’ll have to leave.” I said,
“I didn’t know it was a government lake. Why should it be
off-limits?” He said, “I’m sorry. You’ll have to leave.”
“I don’t even know where I am,” I said. “You’ll still have
to leave,” he said. “What about that man out there?” I said,
pointing to the tire. “He’s dead,” he said. “No, he’s not.
I just saw him move his arm,” I said. He removed his pistol from
his holster and fired a shot. “Now he’s dead,” he said.

The sun made a temple of the bones

strung into this brave necklace around
my neck. I hear Chief Standing Bear

In other people’s offices

Floated haphazardly on possibles

Firm as agreements of subjective verbs

Glow in the glasses lined before her face

Linen napkins and hope’s frozen green peas
Set up another round of handshake laughter for the pictures

Rebecca paces a double line of rust
in a sandy trench, striding on black

wartrains skidded tanks,
airframes, dynamos, searchlights, and troops

from the stopped hayrack at the endless crossing:
ninety-nine, one hundred; and her grandfather Ben’s
voice shaking with rage and oratory told
how the mighty Boston and Maine
kept the Statehouse in its pocket.
                                                   Today Rebecca walks
a line that vanishes, in solitude
bypassed by wars and commerce. She remembers the story
of the bunting’d day her great-great-great-
grandmother watched the first train roll and smoke
from Potter Place to Gale
with fireworks, cider, and speeches. Then the long rail
drove west, buzzing and humming; the hive of rolling stock
extended a thousand-car’d perspective
from Ohio to Oregon, where men who left stone farms
rode rails toward gold.

its feathery contrail westward. She sees ahead
how the jet dies into junk, and highway wastes
like railroad. Beside her the old creation retires,
hayrack sunk like a rowboat
under its fields of hay. She closes her eyes
to glimpse the vertical track that rises
from the underworld of graves,
soul’s ascension connecting dead to unborn, rails
that hum with a hymn of continual vanishing
where tracks cross.
                            For she opens her eyes to read
on a solitary gravestone next to the rails
the familiar names of Ruth and Matthew Bott, born
in a Norfolk parish, who ventured
the immigrant’s passionate Exodus westward to labor
on their own land. Here love builds
its mortal house, where today’s wind carries

All afternoon you worked at cutting them down.
Branch after branch tossed
into the heap. You had your ceremony. Old pants. The pipe.
The pipe rested in the cleft of the tree.
When the pile got big enough, you threw the kerosene.
Now the woods are clouded again. You forgot
the world could be this messy.
Air thickens into leaves, the leaves into worms.
Behind the barn, overnight, it seems,
tents have spread out in the apple trees.
There’s work for you. So you come back
in your pants old as dirt. With a pipe heavy as stone.
No time to lose. Whatever is rotten,
whatever won’t hold the weight of another season,
you hack down. There’s one moment, though,
when you feel almost sorry for them.
The tents break into flame and the small, black
pieces of anguish crawl
out into the grass. Those that get away, well,
you let them get away this time.

It is not to be bought for a penny
in the candy store, nor picked
from the bushes in the park. It may be found, perhaps,
in the ashes on the distant lots,
among the rusting cans and Jimpson weeds.
If you wish to eat fish freely,
cucumbers and melons,
you should have stayed in Egypt.
II
I am alone—
and glad to be alone;
I do not like people who walk about
so late; who walk slowly after midnight
through the leaves fallen on the sidewalks.
I do not like
my own face
in the little mirrors of the slot-machines
before the closed stores.
III
Walking along the highway,
I smell the yellow flowers of a shrub,
watch the starlings on a lawn, perhaps—
but why are all these   
speeding away in automobiles,
where are they off to
in such a hurry?
They must be going to hear wise men
and to look at beautiful women,   
and I am just a fool
to be loitering here alone.
IV
I like the sound of the street—
but I, apart and alone,
beside an open window
and behind a closed door.
V
Winter is here indeed; the leaves have long been swept
from the winding walks; trees and ground are brown—
all is in order.
Only the lamps now flourish in the park.
We walk about and talk;
but the troubles of the unsuccessful middle-aged
are so uninteresting!
VI
Now it is cold: where the snow was melting
the walk crackles with black ice beneath my careful steps;
and the snow is old and pitted,
here grey with ashes and there yellow with sand.
The walks lie in the cold shadow
of houses;
pigeons and sparrows are in a hollow
for cold, out of the wind; but here,   
where the sunshine pours through a narrow street
upon a little tree, black and naked of every leaf,
the sparrows are in the sun, thick upon the twigs.
Those who in their lives braved the anger of their fellows,
bronze statues now,
with outstretched arm or sword
brave only the weather.
I find myself talking aloud
as I walk;
that is bad.
Only Don Juan would believe
I am in conversation with the
snow-covered statues;
only St. Francis   
that I am talking to the sparrows
in the naked bushes,   
to the pigeons   
in the snow.

the street dark and still

because of the foolishness
I have spoken.

I do not believe that David killed Goliath.
It must have been—
you will find the name in the list of David’s captains.
But, whoever it was, he was no fool
when he took off the helmet
and put down the sword and the spear and the shield
and said, The weapons you have given me are good,
but they are not mine:
I will fight in my own way
with a couple of pebbles and a sling.
XI
“Shall I go there?” “As you like—
it will not matter; you are not at all important.”
The words stuck to me   
like burrs. The path was hidden
under the fallen leaves; and here and there
the stream was choked. Where it forced a way
the ripples flashed a second.
She spoke unkindly but it was the truth:
I shared the sunshine like a leaf, a ripple;
thinking of this, sunned myself
and, for the moment, was content.
XII
There is nobody in the street
of those who crowded about David
to watch me   
as I dance before the Lord:
alone in my unimportance
to do as I like.
XIII
Your angry words—each false name
sinks into me, and is added to the heap
beneath. I am still the same:
they are no part of me, which I keep;
but the way I go, and over which I flow.
XIVThe Bridge
In a cloud bones of steel.
XVGod and Messenger

suddenly in the street

A beggar stretches out his hand
to touch a fur collar, and strokes it unseen,
stealing its warmth for his finger tips.
XVII
The elevator man, working long hours
for little—whose work is dull and trivial—
must also greet each passenger
pleasantly:
to be so heroic
he wears a uniform.
XVIII
This subway station   
with its electric lights, pillars of steel, arches of cement, and trains—
quite an improvement on the caves of the cave-men;
but, look! on this wall
a primitive drawing.
XIXSubway
People moving, people standing still, crowds
and more crowds; a thousand and ten thousand iron girders
as pillars;
escape!
But how,
shut up in the moving train?
And upstairs, in the street,
the sun is shining as it shines in June.
XXPoet with Whiskey Bottle and Sailor
There is anguish there, certainly,
and a commotion
in the next room;
shouts of
words and phrases that do not make sentences

I open the door:
ah, the hallway is crowded—
descendants of the three wise men,   
now male and female,
come again to worship in a stable.

Pardon us for uttering a handful
of words in any language, so cut loose
are we from homes, and from His name that is still   
nameless, blessed be He. We raised a prayer house—
that is, we broke new wood for one, but some
tough burned it, snarling: “Carve only stones for the dead.”
Damp ground, no fire, no psalm we all remember.   
But tall ships anchor here, and at low tide,
people with wheat-colored hair look out to sea,   
just as we’d searched for land. “Pray if you must,”
my father said, “and when prayer fails, a story,   
if it is all you have, will do.” Months past,
we left Recife’s forced-worship laws in the year
of their Lord sixteen hundred and fifty-four, for our new   
world, old-country Amsterdam. Leagues seaward,   
Spanish pirates slaughtered our scant crew,
and all that was left of us (friends wheezed
their last while they ragged us on) rose up on deck   
and tossed our bags in the sea. We watched the wake   
turn silver: kiddish wine cups, hanging bowls,
a candelabrum for the promised altar,
carved pointers. Books’ pages curled and sank,
prayer shawls ballooned and, soaking, spiraled downward.   
Just as we stared, again we heard swords clank—
a French ship, the Ste. Catherine (her prow had shone   
gold on a gray horizon), came to our
port side and rescued us. In that commotion
on deck, we crouched below—not out of fear,
I swear, but stunned by luminous words
that echoed oddly—beautifully—like lightning   
flickering through palls of thickset clouds.   
A jaunty captain rasped to us in hiding:
“Where are you bound?”
                                  “Amsterdam. Old country.”
“Where?”
             “Amsterdam.”
                                 “Antilles?”
                                                   “No, Amsterdam.”
“Yes, yes. Nieuw Amsterdam. I’ll see
you get there safely.” He meant well, bless him.Ste. Catherine sailed to land at its tip no larger   
than a meadow, fanned out at its sides:
Manhattan Island. Our new master,
Stuyvesant, lashed us with phrases, wheffs, guzzads,
that stung but were not fathomed, mercifully,   
when we came on a Sabbath, more than twenty   
men, women, a baby born at sea.
Still cursing, he let us land, and heard our praise,
then disappeared among lank citizens
with faded skin who stride to the bay and brood   
on water that we trust and dread, and listen   
to tales unstamped by laws and never sacred.

but isn’t, because he can’t not take
whatever’s said to him as judgement.
It causes him, as he puts it, to react.
His face and neck redden and bloat,
a thick blue vein bulges up his forehead
and bisects his bald pate, scaring his children
but provoking hilarity at work
where one guy likes to get his goat
by pasting pro-choice bumper stickers
on his computer screen while he’s in the john,
then gathers a group into the next cubicle
to watch when he comes back.
He has talked to his minister and to his wife
about learning how not to react,
to make a joke, and he has tried to make jokes,
but his voice gets tense, they come out flat,
so even his joke becomes a joke at his expense,
another thing to laugh at him about.
He has thought to turn to them and ask,Why don’t you like me? What have I done to you? 
But he has been told already all his life:
self-righteous goody two-shoes, a stick up your ass.
They are right. He has never never never gotten along.
He says nothing this time, just peels off the bumper sticker,
crumples it gently, places it gently
by his mousepad to dispose of later properly,
comparing his suffering to Christ’s in Gethsemane
spat upon and mocked (his minister’s advice),
and tries a smile that twists into a grimace,
which starts the hot blood rising into his face.
This is what they came for, to see Dickhead,
the bulging vein, the skull stoplight red,
and indeed it is remarkable how gorged it gets
as if his torso had become a helium pump,
so, except for him whose eyes are shut tight,
they burst into laughter together exactly at the moment
cruelty turns into astonishment.

Who is your lady of love, O ye that pass Singing? and is it for sorrow of that which was        That ye sing sadly, or dream of what shall be?                For gladly at once and sadly it seems ye sing. — Our lady of love by you is unbeholden; For hands she hath none, nor eyes, nor lips, nor golden        Treasure of hair, nor face nor form; but we                That love, we know her more fair than anything. — Is she a queen, having great gifts to give? — Yea, these; that whoso hath seen her shall not live        Except he serve her sorrowing, with strange pain,                Travail and bloodshedding and bitterer tears; And when she bids die he shall surely die. And he shall leave all things under the sky        And go forth naked under sun and rain                And work and wait and watch out all his years. — Hath she on earth no place of habitation? — Age to age calling, nation answering nation,        Cries out, Where is she? and there is none to say;                For if she be not in the spirit of men, For if in the inward soul she hath no place, In vain they cry unto her, seeking her face,        In vain their mouths make much of her; for they                Cry with vain tongues, till the heart lives again. — O ye that follow, and have ye no repentance? For on your brows is written a mortal sentence,        An hieroglyph of sorrow, a fiery sign,                That in your lives ye shall not pause or rest, Nor have the sure sweet common love, nor keep Friends and safe days, nor joy of life nor sleep.        — These have we not, who have one thing, the divine                Face and clear eyes of faith and fruitful breast. — And ye shall die before your thrones be won. — Yea, and the changed world and the liberal sun        Shall move and shine without us, and we lie                Dead; but if she too move on earth and live, But if the old world with all the old irons rent Laugh and give thanks, shall we be not content?        Nay, we shall rather live, we shall not die,                Life being so little and death so good to give. — And these men shall forget you.—Yea, but we Shall be a part of the earth and the ancient sea,        And heaven-high air august, and awful fire,                And all things good; and no man's heart shall beat But somewhat in it of our blood once shed Shall quiver and quicken, as now in us the dead        Blood of men slain and the old same life's desire                Plants in their fiery footprints our fresh feet. — But ye that might be clothed with all things pleasant, Ye are foolish that put off the fair soft present,        That clothe yourselves with the cold future air;                When mother and father and tender sister and brother And the old live love that was shall be as ye, Dust, and no fruit of loving life shall be.        — She shall be yet who is more than all these were,                Than sister or wife or father unto us or mother. — Is this worth life, is this, to win for wages? Lo, the dead mouths of the awful grey-grown ages,        The venerable, in the past that is their prison,                   In the outer darkness, in the unopening grave, Laugh, knowing how many as ye now say have said, How many, and all are fallen, are fallen and dead:        Shall ye dead rise, and these dead have not risen?                —Not we but she, who is tender and swift to save. — Are ye not weary and faint not by the way, Seeing night by night devoured of day by day,        Seeing hour by hour consumed in sleepless fire?                Sleepless: and ye too, when shall ye too sleep? — We are weary in heart and head, in hands and feet, And surely more than all things sleep were sweet,        Than all things save the inexorable desire                Which whoso knoweth shall neither faint nor weep. — Is this so sweet that one were fain to follow? Is this so sure where all men's hopes are hollow.        Even this your dream, that by much tribulation                Ye shall make whole flawed hearts, and bowed necks straight? — Nay, though our life were blind, our death were fruitless, Not therefore were the whole world's high hope rootless;        But man to man, nation would turn to nation,                And the old life live, and the old great world be great. — Pass on then and pass by us and let us be, For what light think ye after life to see?        And if the world fare better will ye know?                And if man triumph who shall seek you and say? — Enough of light is this for one life's span, That all men born are mortal, but not man:        And we men bring death lives by night to sow,                That man may reap and eat and live by day.

I rode one evening with Count MaddaloUpon the bank of land which breaks the flowOf Adria towards Venice: a bare strandOf hillocks, heap'd from ever-shifting sand,Matted with thistles and amphibious weeds,Such as from earth's embrace the salt ooze breeds,Is this; an uninhabited sea-side,Which the lone fisher, when his nets are dried,Abandons; and no other object breaksThe waste, but one dwarf tree and some few stakesBroken and unrepair'd, and the tide makesA narrow space of level sand thereon,Where 'twas our wont to ride while day went down.This ride was my delight. I love all wasteAnd solitary places; where we tasteThe pleasure of believing what we seeIs boundless, as we wish our souls to be:And such was this wide ocean, and this shoreMore barren than its billows; and yet moreThan all, with a remember'd friend I loveTo ride as then I rode; for the winds droveThe living spray along the sunny airInto our faces; the blue heavens were bare,Stripp'd to their depths by the awakening north;And, from the waves, sound like delight broke forthHarmonizing with solitude, and sentInto our hearts aëreal merriment.So, as we rode, we talk'd; and the swift thought,Winging itself with laughter, linger'd not,But flew from brain to brain—such glee was ours,Charg'd with light memories of remember'd hours,None slow enough for sadness: till we cameHomeward, which always makes the spirit tame.This day had been cheerful but cold, and nowThe sun was sinking, and the wind also.Our talk grew somewhat serious, as may beTalk interrupted with such railleryAs mocks itself, because it cannot scornThe thoughts it would extinguish: 'twas forlorn,Yet pleasing, such as once, so poets tell,The devils held within the dales of HellConcerning God, freewill and destiny:Of all that earth has been or yet may be,All that vain men imagine or believe,Or hope can paint or suffering may achieve,We descanted, and I (for ever stillIs it not wise to make the best of ill?)Argu'd against despondency, but prideMade my companion take the darker side.The sense that he was greater than his kindHad struck, methinks, his eagle spirit blindBy gazing on its own exceeding light.Meanwhile the sun paus'd ere it should alight,Over the horizon of the mountains—Oh,How beautiful is sunset, when the glowOf Heaven descends upon a land like thee,Thou Paradise of exiles, Italy!Thy mountains, seas, and vineyards, and the towersOf cities they encircle! It was oursTo stand on thee, beholding it: and then,Just where we had dismounted, the Count's menWere waiting for us with the gondola.As those who pause on some delightful wayThough bent on pleasant pilgrimage, we stoodLooking upon the evening, and the floodWhich lay between the city and the shore,Pav'd with the image of the sky.... The hoarAnd aëry Alps towards the North appear'dThrough mist, an heaven-sustaining bulwark rear'dBetween the East and West; and half the skyWas roof'd with clouds of rich emblazonryDark purple at the zenith, which still grewDown the steep West into a wondrous hueBrighter than burning gold, even to the rentWhere the swift sun yet paus'd in his descentAmong the many-folded hills: they wereThose famous Euganean hills, which bear,As seen from Lido thro' the harbour piles,The likeness of a clump of peakèd isles—And then—as if the Earth and Sea had beenDissolv'd into one lake of fire, were seenThose mountains towering as from waves of flameAround the vaporous sun, from which there cameThe inmost purple spirit of light, and madeTheir very peaks transparent. ""Ere it fade,""Said my companion, ""I will show you soonA better station""—so, o'er the laguneWe glided; and from that funereal barkI lean'd, and saw the city, and could markHow from their many isles, in evening's gleam,Its temples and its palaces did seemLike fabrics of enchantment pil'd to Heaven.I was about to speak, when—""We are evenNow at the point I meant,"" said Maddalo,And bade the gondolieri cease to row.""Look, Julian, on the west, and listen wellIf you hear not a deep and heavy bell.""I look'd, and saw between us and the sunA building on an island; such a oneAs age to age might add, for uses vile,A windowless, deform'd and dreary pile;And on the top an open tower, where hungA bell, which in the radiance sway'd and swung;We could just hear its hoarse and iron tongue:The broad sun sunk behind it, and it toll'dIn strong and black relief. ""What we beholdShall be the madhouse and its belfry tower,""Said Maddalo, ""and ever at this hourThose who may cross the water, hear that bellWhich calls the maniacs, each one from his cell,To vespers."" ""As much skill as need to prayIn thanks or hope for their dark lot have theyTo their stern Maker,"" I replied. ""O ho!You talk as in years past,"" said Maddalo."" 'Tis strange men change not. You were ever stillAmong Christ's flock a perilous infidel,A wolf for the meek lambs—if you can't swimBeware of Providence."" I look'd on him,But the gay smile had faded in his eye.""And such,"" he cried, ""is our mortality,And this must be the emblem and the signOf what should be eternal and divine!And like that black and dreary bell, the soul,Hung in a heaven-illumin'd tower, must tollOur thoughts and our desires to meet belowRound the rent heart and pray—as madmen doFor what? they know not—till the night of death,As sunset that strange vision, severethOur memory from itself, and us from allWe sought and yet were baffled."" I recallThe sense of what he said, although I marThe force of his expressions. The broad starOf day meanwhile had sunk behind the hill,And the black bell became invisible,And the red tower look'd gray, and all betweenThe churches, ships and palaces were seenHuddled in gloom;—into the purple seaThe orange hues of heaven sunk silently.We hardly spoke, and soon the gondolaConvey'd me to my lodgings by the way.
    The following morn was rainy, cold and dim:Ere Maddalo arose, I call'd on him,And whilst I waited with his child I play'd;A lovelier toy sweet Nature never made,A serious, subtle, wild, yet gentle being,Graceful without design and unforeseeing,With eyes—Oh speak not of her eyes!—which seemTwin mirrors of Italian Heaven, yet gleamWith such deep meaning, as we never seeBut in the human countenance: with meShe was a special favourite: I had nurs'dHer fine and feeble limbs when she came firstTo this bleak world; and she yet seem'd to knowOn second sight her ancient playfellow,Less chang'd than she was by six months or so;For after her first shyness was worn outWe sate there, rolling billiard balls about,When the Count enter'd. Salutations past—""The word you spoke last night might well have castA darkness on my spirit—if man beThe passive thing you say, I should not seeMuch harm in the religions and old saws(Though I may never own such leaden laws)Which break a teachless nature to the yoke:Mine is another faith""—thus much I spokeAnd noting he replied not, added: ""SeeThis lovely child, blithe, innocent and free;She spends a happy time with little care,While we to such sick thoughts subjected areAs came on you last night. It is our willThat thus enchains us to permitted ill.We might be otherwise. We might be allWe dream of happy, high, majestical.Where is the love, beauty, and truth we seekBut in our mind? and if we were not weakShould we be less in deed than in desire?""""Ay, if we were not weak—and we aspireHow vainly to be strong!"" said Maddalo:""You talk Utopia."" ""It remains to know,""I then rejoin'd, ""and those who try may findHow strong the chains are which our spirit bind;Brittle perchance as straw.... We are assur'dMuch may be conquer'd, much may be endur'd,Of what degrades and crushes us. We knowThat we have power over ourselves to doAnd suffer—what, we know not till we try;But something nobler than to live and die:So taught those kings of old philosophyWho reign'd, before Religion made men blind;And those who suffer with their suffering kindYet feel their faith, religion."" ""My dear friend,""Said Maddalo, ""my judgement will not bendTo your opinion, though I think you mightMake such a system refutation-tightAs far as words go. I knew one like youWho to this city came some months ago,With whom I argu'd in this sort, and heIs now gone mad—and so he answer'd me—Poor fellow! but if you would like to goWe'll visit him, and his wild talk will showHow vain are such aspiring theories.""""I hope to prove the induction otherwise,And that a want of that true theory, still,Which seeks a 'soul of goodness' in things illOr in himself or others, has thus bow'dHis being. There are some by nature proud,Who patient in all else demand but this—To love and be belov'd with gentleness;And being scorn'd, what wonder if they dieSome living death? this is not destinyBut man's own wilful ill.""
                                         As thus I spokeServants announc'd the gondola, and weThrough the fast-falling rain and high-wrought seaSail'd to the island where the madhouse stands.

when I was just seven and eight.
He was the newly hired pastor,
 
an albino, alarming sight
with his transparent eyelashes
and mouse-pink skin that looked like it
 
might hurt whenever she caressed
his arm. Since Eva was her name,
to my child’s mind it made great sense
 
that she should fall in love with him.
He was Adán. Before the Fall
and afterward, her invert twin.
 
And she, Eva, was blonde as well,
though more robust, like Liv Ullmann.
I loved her honey hair, her full
 
lips; her green eyes a nameless sin.
(Not that I worried all that much—
the church was Presbyterian.)
 
In Sunday school, her way to teach
us kids to pray was to comment
on all the beauty we could touch
 
or see in our environment.
My hand was always in the air
to volunteer my sentiment.
 
Since other kids considered prayer
a chore, the floor was usually mine.
My list of joys left out her hair
 
but blessed the red hibiscus seen
through the windows while others bowed
their heads. Her heart I schemed to win
 
with purple prose on meringue clouds.
—For who was Adán, anyway,
I thought, but nada spelled backward?
 
While hers, reversed, called out, Ave! Ave! The lyric of a bird
born and airborne on the same day.
 
But it was night when I saw her
outside the church for the last time:
yellow light, mosquitoes, summer.
 
I shaped a barking dog, a fine
but disembodied pair of wings
with my hands. She spoke in hushed tones
 
to my parents. The next day I would find
myself up north, in a strange house,
without my tongue and almost blind,
 
there was so much to see. This caused
Cuba, my past, to be eclipsed
in time, but Eva stayed, a loss.
 Ave, I learned, meant also this:Farewell! I haven’t seen her since.

In the grassy space between the wings of the elementary school and the trailers housing the fifth grade’s overflow classrooms, girls flip their hair in imitation of Cindy Crawford, sing Iko Iko. None of you know what it means or where the song comes from.
It’s honor-roll season, a time of outings to TCBY and Outback Steakhouse. Your mother warns you against filling up on bread, but it’s hard to resist the little brown loaves brought warm to the table with soft butter – a luxury that cannot be imagined at home, with its always-refrigerated margarine and Pepperidge Farm sandwich loaves.
Everyone knows what’s popular but nobody knows how to act. At ten, you lack any context. The world swims before you, and it constantly stings. Its favorite barb: “everybody knows that.”
Beyond the grassy space of girls is more grass, a quarter-mile loop of track, a church with a painfully white spire, a fence, and a neighborhood maybe a little less nice than yours, crammed between the school and busy Great Neck Road. The fence is of chain link, instead of wooden slats. That’s how you know about the niceness – that and the something hard, like a grain of sand, you feel in your mother’s voice, when she takes you to the school’s Spring Fling, where you win another goldfish. They always die, but you’re getting better. Now, it takes a while.Loblollies shiverIn May heat. The world’s ending.The world’s a mirage.

The morning coffee. I'm not sure why I drink it. Maybe it's the ritual
of the cup, the spoon, the hot water, the milk, and the little heap of
brown grit, the way they come together to form a nail I can hang the
day on. It's something to do between being asleep and being awake.
Surely there's something better to do, though, than to drink a cup of
instant coffee. Such as meditate? About what? About having a cup of
coffee. A cup of coffee whose first drink is too hot and whose last drink
is too cool, but whose many in-between drinks are, like Baby Bear's por-
ridge, just right. Papa Bear looks disgruntled. He removes his spectacles
and swivels his eyes onto the cup that sits before Baby Bear, and then,
after a discrete cough, reaches over and picks it up. Baby Bear doesn't
understand this disruption of the morning routine. Papa Bear brings
the cup close to his face and peers at it intently. The cup shatters in his
paw, explodes actually, sending fragments and brown liquid all over the
room. In a way it's good that Mama Bear isn't there. Better that she rest

For the loftiest hill,Who to the stars uncrowns his majesty,Planting his steadfast footsteps in the sea,Making the heaven of heavens his dwelling-place,Spares but the cloudy border of his baseTo the foil'd searching of mortality;And thou, who didst the stars and sunbeams know,Self-school'd, self-scann'd, self-honour'd, self-secure,Didst tread on earth unguess'd at.—Better so!All pains the immortal spirit must endure,All weakness which impairs, all griefs which bow,Find their sole speech in that victorious brow.

When the fog slunk in with that salivary,  close, coyote panting, its hue a very  huelessness, like breath huffed on a glass,  like the void stretched and still stretching past  where we’d thought it could, we felt less wary.  We felt our shoulders loosen, surrendering  to phantom hands and softly vanished feet.  The sensation was a first and last: sweet  to feel the vigilance at last suspending,  the chronic stress of constantly pretending  to know—have known!—what all the others knew.  Loopy, sly, we leered at one another  (what we just assumed was one another)  and did the things we weren’t supposed to do,  grinning as if seated in the back pew  of a church that worshipped fuss and bother,  a dour church where facial expression    of any kind had been prohibited,  and where the chinking, hefty plate we shifted  hand to hand held such a vast collection  of their coin, we pocketed a fraction  for when the fog would lift, if it lifted.

Mike was all puffed-up, triple size

11 p.m.

Mike died, she said, he’s gone.

yes, he died, she said.

I came an errand one cloud-blowing evening
To a slab-built, black-paper-covered house
Of one room and one window and one door,
The only dwelling in a waste cut over
A hundred square miles round it in the mountains:
And that not dwelt in now by men or women.
(It never had been dwelt in, though, by women,
So what is this I make a sorrow of?)
I came as census-taker to the waste
To count the people in it and found none,
None in the hundred miles, none in the house,
Where I came last with some hope, but not much,
After hours’ overlooking from the cliffs
An emptiness flayed to the very stone.
I found no people that dared show themselves,
None not in hiding from the outward eye.
The time was autumn, but how anyone
Could tell the time of year when every tree
That could have dropped a leaf was down itself
And nothing but the stump of it was left
Now bringing out its rings in sugar of pitch;
And every tree up stood a rotting trunk
Without a single leaf to spend on autumn,
Or branch to whistle after what was spent.
Perhaps the wind the more without the help
Of breathing trees said something of the time
Of year or day the way it swung a door
Forever off the latch, as if rude men
Passed in and slammed it shut each one behind him
For the next one to open for himself.
I counted nine I had no right to count
(But this was dreamy unofficial counting)
Before I made the tenth across the threshold.
Where was my supper? Where was anyone’s?
No lamp was lit. Nothing was on the table.
The stove was cold—the stove was off the chimney—
And down by one side where it lacked a leg.
The people that had loudly passed the door
Were people to the ear but not the eye.
They were not on the table with their elbows.
They were not sleeping in the shelves of bunks.
I saw no men there and no bones of men there.
I armed myself against such bones as might be
With the pitch-blackened stub of an ax-handle
I picked up off the straw-dust covered floor.
Not bones, but the ill-fitted window rattled.
The door was still because I held it shut
While I thought what to do that could be done—
About the house—about the people not there.
This house in one year fallen to decay
Filled me with no less sorrow than the houses
Fallen to ruin in ten thousand years
Where Asia wedges Africa from Europe.
Nothing was left to do that I could see
Unless to find that there was no one there
And declare to the cliffs too far for echo,
“The place is desert, and let whoso lurks
In silence, if in this he is aggrieved,
Break silence now or be forever silent.
Let him say why it should not be declared so.”

Where they grow fewer and fewer every year
Is extreme where they shrink to none at all.

I. Deer Season
 
The quiet of windows pours its sand in my ear.What, what? ask the dolls of evening
 
though they do not wish to hear my answer.
Five hens are alive in the brush, purring
 
toward the slough. No one here has a rifle
but the wind turns abruptly and returns a report.
 
Three bright orange vests hang at the ready.
The doe turns in her frame above the stove,
 
and her season climbs like the moon into its place
in the sky’s clock. The green theater
 
with its elegant aspens goes more threadbare
each week, so I’ll soon see the others, heretofore
 
only heard. Just to the south the casino lights
ride the underbellies of clouds, and further
 
down the interstate more world twirls
in its paper and drinks, while the baby throws
 
his feet through the bars, and the father
takes him like a little canoe on the billowy
 
lake of his chest. Comes a mewling, then,
from my dark, a mooing, a whine, feathered
 
or furred I can’t divine. The girl with the flat face
and bleached lips read her poems in crisp
 
Ivy League whatnot, but I got sidetracked
by the way her torso seemed stacked, pressed
 
in layers like shale, so there was a weight to her
that hung in the bottom of the eye like the bulk
 
of a tear that never quite falls. It’s true
the intelligence was clear as green ice, and just
 
as hard, stripped of its I and heat. Her baby
burbled on in the back of the room happily not
 
in the poems. Oh little rabbit of grief on the spot
where the last dog was turned under, don’t speak.
 
I make a fire, then dream a fire: wind carries
its gray rags into the woods, and the crackling
 
in the grate enters my ducts, wakes me.
When I look out, the grass along the fence
 
is crawling with light, and the last wild asters
press their blue buttons into the cold glass.
 
 
II. The New Year
 
Zero and a fine hard snow burns
when it hits bare skin. A white
 
ridge glows inside the birches
across the slough where snow articulates
 
the distance. Where water moves,
where the land heaves. I haul oak chunks
 
in a plastic sled. When I bend to stack
the splits, my breasts pop and burn,
 
and my child’s face rises like a bird
razoring its shadow over the snow.
 
Wind takes the rag of some old self
and shakes it at me. The heart is only
 
another shape the view stretches to include.
Birches march out of the hardwoods
 
with their white waists radiant, so many
clones on one taproot. A jay circles
 
the full feeders fending off smaller birds.
I make this vocal gesture because self
 
is simply one edge of me. Out here
there’s only an economy of wood burned
 
or to be burned, how much water’s left
in the tank, how hard or soft the light.
 
Degrees and drafts. This room and everything in it
are mine, and though I try to be selfish and grim,
 
my child has made me enduringly plural,
more than I, but not quite we.
 
Black-capped chickadees flee
from three big jays at the feeder. Shrieking
 
and diving in the strong winter light, the jays
are not actually blue. Their feathers refract light
 
so they appear blue. Self-luminous,
hardy and belligerent as pronouns.
 
 
III. Easter
 
The kick of the screw finding purchase in pine
slams my wrist bone, elbow and shoulder,
but it’s in, and the panel is up. Now another
and another until the wall is flush. I mark
 
and cut each length with the small tooth
of the new jigsaw my husband thought
I should have. Two days apart from him
and the child, I’ve forgotten the pump
 
to empty my breasts, so the saw’s jump
at the end of the cut draws the burning
up. And with it a guilt as bright as the room
where I drive plank after plank against the studs,
 
each a satisfaction against the body’s wish
to be elsewhere. Even into the night, I can’t put
down my drill. I stoke the fire and drive
more screws, loving the growl when they’re
 
in as far as they’ll go. The mind arranging
which planks and trim tomorrow, next week
and spring. Even my sleep is a cutting and fastening
broken by my turning on the full globes
 
of my breasts. So toward morning I dream
of parties given by women I used to know,
and to which I’m not and will never be invited,
trays of fancy sandwiches and petit fours,
 
half moon glasses of seething champagne.

For six nights now the cries have sounded in the pasture: coyote voices fluting across the greening rise to the east where the deer have almost ceased to pass now that the developers have carved up yet another section, filled another space with spars and studs, concrete, runoff.Five years ago you saw two spotted fawns rise for the first time from brome where brick mailboxes will stand; only three years past came great horned owls who raised two squeaking, downy owlets that perished in the traffic, skimming too low across the road behind some swift, more fortunate cottontail.It was on an August afternoon that you drove in, curling down our long gravel drive past pasture and creek, that you saw, flickering at the edge of your sight, three mounted Indians, motionless in the paused breeze, who vanished when you turned your head.We have felt the presence on this land of others, of some who paused here, some who passed, who have left in the thick clay shards and splinters of themselves that we dig up, turn up with spade and tine when we garden or bury our animals; their voices whisper on moonless nights in the back pasture hollow where the horses snort and nicker, wary with alarm.

distil there their red and the husbands
hunt lion with spear and paint Death-spore
on their shields, wear his teeth, claws and hair
on ordinary occasions. There the Swahili
open his doors, let loose thru the trees
the tides of Death’s sound and distil
from their leaves the terrible red. He
is the consort of dreams I have seen, heard
in the orchestral dark
like the barking of dogs.
Death is the dog-headed man zebra striped
and surrounded by silence who walks like a lion,
who is black. It was his voice crying come back,
that Virginia Woolf heard, turnd
her fine skull, hounded and haunted, stopt,
pointed into the scent where
I see her in willows, in fog, at the river of sound
in the trees. I see her prepare there
to enter Death’s mountains
like a white Afghan hound pass into the forest,
closed after, let loose in the leaves
with more grace than a hound and more wonder there
even with flowers wound in her hair, allowing herself
like Ophelia a last
pastoral gesture of love toward the world.
          And I see
all our tortures absolved in the fog,
dispersed in Death’s forests, forgotten. I see
all this gentleness like a hound in the water
float upward and outward beyond my dark hand.
I am waiting this winter for the more complete black-out,
for the negro armies in the eucalyptus, for the cities
laid open and the cold in the love-light, for hounds
women and birds to go back to their forests and leave us
our solitude.

like a demon wails within our bodies, warns
against this towering Moor of self and then
laments her passing from him.
And I cry, Hear!
Hear in the coild and secretive ear
the drums that I hear beat. The Negroes, all those princes
holding cups of bone and horn, are there in halls
of blood that I call forests, in the dark
and shining caverns where
beats heart and pulses brain, in
jungles of my body, there
Othello moves, striped black and white,

whom I have seen as black as Orpheus,
pursued deliriously his sound and drownd

This was the beginning of the ending year.
From all of the empty the tortured appear,
and the bird-faced children crawl out of their fathers

The halls of Africa we seek in dreams
as barriers of dream against the deep, and seas
disturbd turn back upon their tides

      He will learn to hit the target without aiming
      when he has died in his mind. I am not scared of death,
      though I am appalled at how obsession with security

      to revel in the touch of hips, hair, lips, hands,
      feel the collapse of space in December light.

      a moment when someone turns on a light
      and turns a window into a mirror,

      “When will it be tomorrow?”
      To say “A bell cannot be red and violet

Bing Crosby died in Spain while playing golf with Franco but who could care less, and at this writing only a few of my dear ones are gone—ah I could make a sad list—the swifts, as if to prove a point, fly into the light and make a mockery out of our darkness. They scream for food but in the world of shadows they only make a quick motion; I have studied them—the whiter the wall is—the barer the bulb— the more they scream, the more they dip down. I have made my two hands into a shape and I have darkened the wall to see what it looks like—I have shortened my two broken fingers to make the small tail and twisted the knuckles sideways so when they come in to eat one shadow overtakes the other, that way I can live in the darkness with Franco's poisonous head and Crosby's ears, who fainted, a thousand to one, behind a number two club, though no swift died for him, well, for them, digging for clubs. I watch the birds every night; they fly in a great circle, much larger than what I can see, their dipping is what I dreaded in front of my plain white wall—I say it for the nine hundred Americans who died in Spain. I thought I'd have to wait forever to do them a tiny justice and listen to their songs and die a little from the foolhardy mournful words, flying down one air current or another and doing the sides of buildings and tops of trees, the low-lying straggling dogwood, the full-bodied huge red maple, my dear ones.

The doctor may come, and we’ll teach him to know     A tee where no tannin can lurk; The soldier may come, and we’ll promise to show     Some hazards a soldier may shirk; The statesman may joke, as he tops every stroke,     That at last he is high in his aims; And the clubman will stand with a club in his hand     That is worth every club in St. James’.

Fish
    always accurately know where to move and when,
    and likewise
    birds have an accurate built-in time sense

Humanity, however,
    lacking such instincts resorts to scientific
    research. Its nature is illustrated by the following
    occurrence.
A certain soldier
    had to fire a cannon at six o’clock sharp every evening.
    Being a soldier he did so. When his accuracy was
    investigated he explained:
I go by
    the absolutely accurate chronometer in the window
    of the clockmaker down in the city. Every day at seventeen
    forty-five I set my watch by it and
    climb the hill where my cannon stands ready.
    At seventeen fifty-nine precisely I step up to the cannon
    and at eighteen hours sharp I fire.
And it was clear
    that this method of firing was absolutely accurate.
    All that was left was to check that chronometer. So
    the clockmaker down in the city was questioned about
    his instrument’s accuracy.
Oh, said the clockmaker,
    this is one of the most accurate instruments ever. Just imagine,
    for many years now a cannon has been fired at six o’clock sharp.
    And every day I look at this chronometer
    and always it shows exactly six.
Chronometers tick and cannon boom.

Each instant comes with a price, the blue-edged bill
on the draft of a bird almost incarnadine,
the shanked ochre of an inn that sits as still
as the beavertail cactus it guards (the fine
rose of that flower gone as bronze as sand),
the river's chalky white insistence as it
moves past the gray afternoon toward sunset.
Autumn feels the chill of a late summer lit
only by goldenrod and a misplaced strand
of blackberries; deplores all such sleight of hand;
turns sullen, selfish, envious, full of regret.
Someone more adept would mute its voice. The spill
of its truncated experience would shine
less bravely and, out of the dust and dunghill
of this existence (call it hope, in decline),
as here the blue light of autumn falls, command
what is left of exhilaration and fit
this season's unfolding to the alphabet
of turn and counterturn, all that implicit
arc of a heart searching for a place to stand.
Yet even that diminished voice can withstand
the currying of its spirit. Here lies—not yet.
If, and only if, the leafless rose he sees,
or thinks he sees, flowered a moment ago,
this endangered heart flows with the river that flees
the plain, and listens with eye raised to the slow
revelation of cloud, hoping to approve
himself, or to admonish the rose for slight
transgressions of the past, this the ecstatic
ethos, a logic that seems set to reprove
his facility with unsettling delight.
Autumn might be only desire, a Twelfth Night
gone awry, a gift almost too emphatic.
Logic in a faithful light somehow appeases
the rose, and stirs the hummingbird's vibrato.
By moving, I can stand where the light eases
me into the river's feathered arms, and, so,
with the heat of my devotion, again prove
devotion, if not this moment, pure, finite.
Autumn cradles me with idiomatic
certainty, leaves me nothing to disapprove.
I now acknowledge this red moon, to requite
the heart alone given power to recite
its faith, what a cradled life finds emblematic.

First there is the wind but not like the familiar wind but long and without lapses or falling away or surges of air as is usual but rather like the persistent pressure of a river or a running tide.

   When the air has this taste of time the frontiers are not far from us.
   Then too there are the animals. There are always animals under the small trees. They belong neither to our side nor to theirs but are wild and because they are animals of such kind that wildness is unfamiliar in them as the horse for example or the goat and often sheep and dogs and like creatures their wandering there is strange and even terrifying signaling as it does the violation of custom and the subversion of order.
   There are also the unnatural lovers the distortion of images the penetration of mirrors and the inarticulate meanings of the dreams. The dreams are in turmoil like a squall of birds.

When you put on the mask the thunder starts.
Through the nostril’s orange you can smell
the far hope of rain. Up in the Nilgiris,
glisten of eucalyptus, drip of pine, spiders tumbling
from their silver webs.The mask is raw and red as bark against your facebones. 
You finger the stripes ridged like weals
out of your childhood. A wind is rising
in the north, a scarlet light
like a fire in the sky.When you look through the eyeholes it is like falling.
Night gauzes you in black. You are blind
as in the beginning of the world. Sniff. Seek the moon.
After a while you will know
that creased musky smell is rising
from your skin.Once you locate the ears the drums begin.
Your fur stiffens. A roar from the distant left,
like monsoon water. You swivel your sightless head.
Under your sheathed paw
the ground shifts wet.What is that small wild sound
sheltering in your skull
against the circle that always closes in
just before dawn?NoteThe poem refers to a ritual performed by some Rajasthani hill tribes to ensure

It is easy to love a pig in a nightgown.
See how he sleeps, white flannel
straining his neck at the neckhole.
His body swells and then deflates.
The gown is nothing to be ashamed of, only
the white clay of moonlight smeared
over his hulk, original clothing, the milk

He lowered his head and darted through
the grass, flushing a hen from off her nest,
then zeroing in on the day-old chicks
instead of the mother whose decoy trick
had failed to lure him away. In the time
it took for me to notice this, he'd broken
the necks of two of the chicks and torn
the skin from off their backs and heads.
The taste of their blood had deafened him
to my commands, so I went to him
like an angry god and chased him away
with my staff and rod, inflicting a wound also
in his side for him to go on licking, to wash
their blood from off his tongue with his own blood,
and then I kneeled in the grass to regard his kill
while the mother keened inside the woods
not far away. Oh, what a mess they were
with their heads snapped back and wings
unhinged. I picked up the bodies
like bloody socks and prayed to the god
in charge of this field for my own weakness
to feel this much for slaughtered chicks.
For an understanding of his need to kill
the most vulnerable thing, whether hungry or not.

What large, dark hands are those at the window
Lifted, grasping the golden light
Which weaves its way through the creeper leaves
       To my heart's delight?
Ah, only the leaves! But in the west,
In the west I see a redness come
Over the evening's burning breast —
       — 'Tis the wound of love goes home!
The woodbine creeps abroad
Calling low to her lover:
The sun-lit flirt who all the day
Has poised above her lips in play
And stolen kisses, shallow and gay
Of pollen, now has gone away
— She woos the moth with her sweet, low word,
And when above her his broad wings hover
Then her bright breast she will uncover
And yield her honey-drop to her lover.
Into the yellow, evening glow
Saunters a man from the farm below,
Leans, and looks in at the low-built shed
Where hangs the swallow's marriage bed.
The bird lies warm against the wall.
She glances quick her startled eyes
Towards him, then she turns away
Her small head, making warm display
Of red upon the throat. His terrors sway
Her out of the nest's warm, busy ball,
Whose plaintive cry is heard as she flies
In one blue stoop from out the sties
Into the evening's empty hall.
Oh, water-hen, beside the rushes
Hide your quaint, unfading blushes,
Still your quick tail, and lie as dead,
Till the distance folds over his ominous tread.
The rabbit presses back her ears,
Turns back her liquid, anguished eyes
And crouches low: then with wild spring
Spurts from the terror of his oncoming
To be choked back, the wire ring
Her frantic effort throttling:
Piteous brown ball of quivering fears!
Ah soon in his large, hard hands she dies,
And swings all loose to the swing of his walk.
Yet calm and kindly are his eyes
And ready to open in brown surprise
Should I not answer to his talk
Or should he my tears surmise.
I hear his hand on the latch, and rise from my chair
Watching the door open: he flashes bare
His strong teeth in a smile, and flashes his eyes
In a smile like triumph upon me; then careless-wise
He flings the rabbit soft on the table board
And comes towards me: ah, the uplifted sword
Of his hand against my bosom, and oh, the broad
Blade of his hand that raises my face to applaud
His coming: he raises up my face to him
And caresses my mouth with his fingers, which still smell grim
Of the rabbit's fur! God, I am caught in a snare!
I know not what fine wire is round my throat,
I only know I let him finger there
My pulse of life, letting him nose like a stoat
Who sniffs with joy before he drinks the blood:
And down his mouth comes to my mouth, and down
His dark bright eyes descend like a fiery hood
Upon my mind: his mouth meets mine, and a flood
Of sweet fire sweeps across me, so I drown
Within him, die, and find death good.

Full cooler in the trunk, Ray sogging the beer

All day the sky lowers, clears, lowers again.
Somewhere in the bush near Saint John
there are uncles, a family, one mysterious brother
who stayed on the land when Ray left for the cities.
One week Ray is crocked. We’ve been through this before.   
Even, as a little girl, hands in my dress,Ah punka, you’s my Debby, come and ki me. 
Then the road ends in a yard full of dogs.
Them’s Indian dogs, Ray says, lookit how they know me.   
And they do seem to know him, like I do. His odor—
rank beef of fierce turtle pulled dripping from Metagoshe,   
and the inflammable mansmell: hair tonic, ashes, alcohol.   
Ray dances an old woman up in his arms.
Fiddles reel in the phonograph and I sink apart
in a corner, start knocking the Blue Ribbons down.   
Four generations of people live here.
No one remembers Raymond Twobears.
So what. The walls shiver, the old house caulked with mud   
sails back into the middle of Metagoshe.
A three-foot-long snapper is hooked on a fishline,   
so mean that we do not dare wrestle him in
but tow him to shore, heavy as an old engine.
Then somehow Ray pries the beak open and shoves   
down a cherry bomb. Lights the string tongue.
Headless and clenched in its armor, the snapper
is lugged home in the trunk for tomorrow’s soup.
Ray rolls it beneath a bush in the backyard and goes in   
to sleep his own head off. Tomorrow I find
that the animal has dragged itself off.
I follow torn tracks up a slight hill and over
into a small stream that deepens and widens into a marsh.
Ray finds his way back through the room into his arms.   
When the phonograph stops, he slumps hard in his hands   
and the boys and their old man fold him into the car
where he curls around his bad heart, hearing how it knocks   
and rattles at the bars of his ribs to break out.
Somehow we find our way back. Uncle Ray   
sings an old song to the body that pulls him
toward home. The gray fins that his hands have become   
screw their bones in the dashboard. His face   
has the odd, calm patience of a child who has always
let bad wounds alone, or a creature that has lived   
for a long time underwater. And the angels come   
lowering their slings and litters.

1Once in Mexico an old man was
leading on a string—was it a cat?
And we saw it was a tarantula
sidling along in the dust, writing
a message from God for people who
thought they knew where creature-life ended.
2We came upon scenes like that,
the world back of a lurid pane of glass.   
Like in Reno—they have emptied   
Hollywood and ordered the extras and   
the stars to go get married and divorced   
in Reno, making up their stories as they   
go and letting their little dogs
decide which machines or churches   
to put nickels and dimes into.
3One day in a cut quick to the bone it was   
white, white; and then the world came in.   
I got a tourniquet going, but the snow
had learned a whole new way to look at the sky,   
as in Maryland in the red fields, how the stones   
come startlingly white, on the battlefields,   
the cemeteries, along the gouged-out roads.   
There history blows about on dandelion seeds.
4On the plains near Wakeeney, above the ground,   
short of the earth, at the level of the eyes,   
a sunset ray extended for miles. We drove along   
it, and let our thoughts down gingerly   
to touch what happened, where Genevieve   
lived. She went out of the world, for death.   
Her town holds quiet in the big plain.   
Lights witness one by one all over what   
still abides. There was no one better.   Her town, her town, her town, the tires   
repeat as we go by.
5For those my friends who want me to know,   
to discover and combine: all my best thoughts   
I roll up and let fall carelessly. It is
better than no one follow even the pattern   
I look onto the back of my hand, for many   
visions I haven’t dared follow may
gather and combine in a flash. Away off.
in a space in the sky, I let the sky look
at me, and I look back and do not say anything.

Up! up! my Friend, and quit your books; Or surely you'll grow double: Up! up! my Friend, and clear your looks; Why all this toil and trouble? The sun above the mountain's head, A freshening lustre mellow Through all the long green fields has spread, His first sweet evening yellow. Books! 'tis a dull and endless strife: Come, hear the woodland linnet, How sweet his music! on my life, There's more of wisdom in it. And hark! how blithe the throstle sings! He, too, is no mean preacher: Come forth into the light of things, Let Nature be your teacher. She has a world of ready wealth, Our minds and hearts to bless— Spontaneous wisdom breathed by health, Truth breathed by cheerfulness. One impulse from a vernal wood May teach you more of man, Of moral evil and of good, Than all the sages can. Sweet is the lore which Nature brings; Our meddling intellect Mis-shapes the beauteous forms of things:— We murder to dissect. Enough of Science and of Art; Close up those barren leaves; Come forth, and bring with you a heart That watches and receives.

Last summer, two discrete young snakes left their skin
on my small porch, two mornings in a row. Being
postmodern now, I pretended as if I did not see
them, nor understand what I knew to be circling
inside me. Instead, every hour I told my son
to stop with his incessant back-chat. I peeled
a banana. And cursed God—His arrogance,
His gall—to still expect our devotion
after creating love. And mosquitoes. I showed
my son the papery dead skins so he could
know, too, what it feels like when something shows up
at your door—twice—telling you what you already know.

Hail to thee, blithe Spirit!
          Bird thou never wert,
     That from Heaven, or near it,
          Pourest thy full heartIn profuse strains of unpremeditated art.
     Higher still and higher
          From the earth thou springest
     Like a cloud of fire;
          The blue deep thou wingest,And singing still dost soar, and soaring ever singest.
     In the golden lightning
          Of the sunken sun,
     O'er which clouds are bright'ning,
          Thou dost float and run;Like an unbodied joy whose race is just begun.
     The pale purple even
          Melts around thy flight;
     Like a star of Heaven,
          In the broad day-lightThou art unseen, but yet I hear thy shrill delight,
     Keen as are the arrows
          Of that silver sphere,
     Whose intense lamp narrows
          In the white dawn clearUntil we hardly see, we feel that it is there.
     All the earth and air
          With thy voice is loud,
     As, when night is bare,
          From one lonely cloudThe moon rains out her beams, and Heaven is overflow'd.
     What thou art we know not;
          What is most like thee?
     From rainbow clouds there flow not
          Drops so bright to seeAs from thy presence showers a rain of melody.
     Like a Poet hidden
          In the light of thought,
     Singing hymns unbidden,
          Till the world is wroughtTo sympathy with hopes and fears it heeded not:
     Like a high-born maiden
          In a palace-tower,
     Soothing her love-laden
          Soul in secret hourWith music sweet as love, which overflows her bower:
     Like a glow-worm golden
          In a dell of dew,
     Scattering unbeholden
          Its a{:e}real hueAmong the flowers and grass, which screen it from the view:
     Like a rose embower'd
          In its own green leaves,
     By warm winds deflower'd,
          Till the scent it givesMakes faint with too much sweet those heavy-winged thieves:
     Sound of vernal showers
          On the twinkling grass,
     Rain-awaken'd flowers,
          All that ever wasJoyous, and clear, and fresh, thy music doth surpass.
     Teach us, Sprite or Bird,
          What sweet thoughts are thine:
     I have never heard
          Praise of love or wineThat panted forth a flood of rapture so divine.
     Chorus Hymeneal,
          Or triumphal chant,
     Match'd with thine would be all
          But an empty vaunt,A thing wherein we feel there is some hidden want.
     What objects are the fountains
          Of thy happy strain?
     What fields, or waves, or mountains?
          What shapes of sky or plain?What love of thine own kind? what ignorance of pain?
     With thy clear keen joyance
          Languor cannot be:
     Shadow of annoyance
          Never came near thee:Thou lovest: but ne'er knew love's sad satiety.
     Waking or asleep,
          Thou of death must deem
     Things more true and deep
          Than we mortals dream,Or how could thy notes flow in such a crystal stream?
     We look before and after,
          And pine for what is not:
     Our sincerest laughter
          With some pain is fraught;Our sweetest songs are those that tell of saddest thought.
     Yet if we could scorn
          Hate, and pride, and fear;
     If we were things born
          Not to shed a tear,I know not how thy joy we ever should come near.
     Better than all measures
          Of delightful sound,
     Better than all treasures
          That in books are found,Thy skill to poet were, thou scorner of the ground!
     Teach me half the gladness
          That thy brain must know,
     Such harmonious madness
          From my lips would flowThe world should listen then, as I am listening now.

Arrived to begin gentrification.

At evening, sitting on this terrace,
When the sun from the west, beyond Pisa, beyond the mountains of Carrara
Departs, and the world is taken by surprise ...
When the tired flower of Florence is in gloom beneath the glowing
Brown hills surrounding ...
When under the arches of the Ponte Vecchio
A green light enters against stream, flush from the west,
Against the current of obscure Arno ...
Look up, and you see things flying
Between the day and the night;
Swallows with spools of dark thread sewing the shadows together.
A circle swoop, and a quick parabola under the bridge arches
Where light pushes through;
A sudden turning upon itself of a thing in the air.
A dip to the water.
And you think:
""The swallows are flying so late!""
Swallows?
Dark air-life looping
Yet missing the pure loop ...
A twitch, a twitter, an elastic shudder in flight
And serrated wings against the sky,
Like a glove, a black glove thrown up at the light,
And falling back.
Never swallows!Bats!
The swallows are gone.
At a wavering instant the swallows gave way to bats
By the Ponte Vecchio ...
Changing guard.
Bats, and an uneasy creeping in one's scalp
As the bats swoop overhead!
Flying madly.
Pipistrello!
Black piper on an infinitesimal pipe.
Little lumps that fly in air and have voices indefinite, wildly vindictive;
Wings like bits of umbrella.
Bats!
Creatures that hang themselves up like an old rag, to sleep;
And disgustingly upside down.
Hanging upside down like rows of disgusting old rags
And grinning in their sleep.
Bats!
In China the bat is symbol for happiness.
Not for me!

Thou hast committed — Fornication: but that was in another country, And besides, the wench is dead. (The Jew of Malta) 



I Among the smoke and fog of a December afternoon You have the scene arrange itself — as it will seem to do— With ""I have saved this afternoon for you""; And four wax candles in the darkened room, Four rings of light upon the ceiling overhead, An atmosphere of Juliet's tomb Prepared for all the things to be said, or left unsaid. We have been, let us say, to hear the latest Pole Transmit the Preludes, through his hair and finger-tips. ""So intimate, this Chopin, that I think his soul Should be resurrected only among friends Some two or three, who will not touch the bloom That is rubbed and questioned in the concert room."" —And so the conversation slips Among velleities and carefully caught regrets Through attenuated tones of violins Mingled with remote cornets And begins. ""You do not know how much they mean to me, my friends, And how, how rare and strange it is, to find In a life composed so much, so much of odds and ends, (For indeed I do not love it ... you knew? you are not blind! How keen you are!) To find a friend who has these qualities, Who has, and gives Those qualities upon which friendship lives. How much it means that I say this to you — Without these friendships — life, what cauchemar!"" Among the winding of the violins And the ariettes Of cracked cornets Inside my brain a dull tom-tom begins Absurdly hammering a prelude of its own, Capricious monotone That is at least one definite ""false note."" — Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance, Admire the monuments, Discuss the late events, Correct our watches by the public clocks. Then sit for half an hour and drink our bocks. II Now that lilacs are in bloom She has a bowl of lilacs in her room And twists one in her fingers while she talks. ""Ah, my friend, you do not know, you do not know What life is, you who hold it in your hands""; (Slowly twisting the lilac stalks) ""You let it flow from you, you let it flow, And youth is cruel, and has no remorse And smiles at situations which it cannot see."" I smile, of course, And go on drinking tea. ""Yet with these April sunsets, that somehow recall My buried life, and Paris in the Spring, I feel immeasurably at peace, and find the world To be wonderful and youthful, after all."" The voice returns like the insistent out-of-tune Of a broken violin on an August afternoon: ""I am always sure that you understand My feelings, always sure that you feel, Sure that across the gulf you reach your hand. You are invulnerable, you have no Achilles' heel. You will go on, and when you have prevailed You can say: at this point many a one has failed. But what have I, but what have I, my friend, To give you, what can you receive from me? Only the friendship and the sympathy Of one about to reach her journey's end. I shall sit here, serving tea to friends ...."" I take my hat: how can I make a cowardly amends For what she has said to me? You will see me any morning in the park Reading the comics and the sporting page. Particularly I remark. An English countess goes upon the stage. A Greek was murdered at a Polish dance, Another bank defaulter has confessed. I keep my countenance, I remain self-possessed Except when a street-piano, mechanical and tired Reiterates some worn-out common song With the smell of hyacinths across the garden Recalling things that other people have desired. Are these ideas right or wrong? III The October night comes down; returning as before Except for a slight sensation of being ill at ease I mount the stairs and turn the handle of the door And feel as if I had mounted on my hands and knees. ""And so you are going abroad; and when do you return? But that's a useless question. You hardly know when you are coming back, You will find so much to learn."" My smile falls heavily among the bric-à-brac. ""Perhaps you can write to me."" My self-possession flares up for a second; This is as I had reckoned. ""I have been wondering frequently of late (But our beginnings never know our ends!) Why we have not developed into friends."" I feel like one who smiles, and turning shall remark Suddenly, his expression in a glass. My self-possession gutters; we are really in the dark. ""For everybody said so, all our friends, They all were sure our feelings would relate So closely! I myself can hardly understand. We must leave it now to fate. You will write, at any rate. Perhaps it is not too late. I shall sit here, serving tea to friends."" And I must borrow every changing shape To find expression ... dance, dance Like a dancing bear, Cry like a parrot, chatter like an ape. Let us take the air, in a tobacco trance— Well! and what if she should die some afternoon, Afternoon grey and smoky, evening yellow and rose; Should die and leave me sitting pen in hand With the smoke coming down above the housetops; Doubtful, for quite a while Not knowing what to feel or if I understand Or whether wise or foolish, tardy or too soon ... Would she not have the advantage, after all? This music is successful with a ""dying fall"" Now that we talk of dying— And should I have the right to smile?

His Grace! impossible! what dead!
Of old age too, and in his bed!

And so inglorious, after all!
Well, since he’s gone, no matter how,
The last loud trump must wake him now:
And, trust me, as the noise grows stronger,
He’d wish to sleep a little longer.
And could he be indeed so old
As by the newspapers we’re told?
Threescore, I think, is pretty high;
’Twas time in conscience he should die
This world he cumbered long enough;
He burnt his candle to the snuff;
And that’s the reason, some folks think,
He left behind so great a stink.
Behold his funeral appears,
Nor widow’s sighs, nor orphan’s tears,
Wont at such times each heart to pierce,
Attend the progress of his hearse.
But what of that, his friends may say,
He had those honours in his day.
True to his profit and his pride,
He made them weep before he died.
    Come hither, all ye empty things,
Ye bubbles raised by breath of kings;
Who float upon the tide of state,
Come hither, and behold your fate.

After the Reformation had settled the loamy soil

Sometime after the Civil War, the bronze wing of liberty

Hung up on body parts in the particulate daylight, you step out of a Beckett play to find yourself in a memory resisting itself, as meat hits the fan so to speak against the white blanket of the grainy void. You never know where it’s going, the body, the boy swathed in bullets with those black eyes pissing a letter-opener in the desert mud near a disabled Mercedes. When things enter the room you think bazooka and check your hat. A puddle of warm ice-cream in anticipation. Here’s where Coney Island drops like a discarded napkin and you can’t go home again. Mucous brimming the banks, a cake of dust in the shape of a rocking chair ticking away. But soon it will snow as exquisite dogs languish from inside a sandwich tied to a parachute. No time for ballads, the table is set.

Light solidifies in cells, the keeper of lost keys. They don’t belong to anyone, the keys. Playing the game backwards reveals nothing a blind child could not guess by the hairs on his arm. The lips on old men are lockboxes in the terminal of no-knowing without gratitude for the despair of angels. You have to suffer, you have to fill up in order to implode, to be recognized for the necessities of commerce. They unhinge, finally, the doors you walk through into phantom stairwells in telephonic hum smelling of wet coal and doll’s hair. Precipitous adjectives gush from a cracked faucet in the chancellery restroom. Someone is stifling laughter from underneath a card table where an electric utility had fallen from his sleeve. They say that trussed birds derive no pleasure from the music of mangled wagons and that gas seeps like a well-kept secret imperiling dust mites in the spleens of hooded maidens locked away from the light. Everything is descending, even the scholarship of the ancient adverbs. Mouths twist into almonds and you wonder how the noise can drown itself out with nothing but nouns and dinner plates and gallows, with history a hiccup waiting to happen.

The music is an absence of colliding masses. You can cut your feet on the proverbial and be too close to hear it, the other music, the suffocation of things that can’t fly. A beautiful cacophony flutters in the brightness of dead calm as true objects lost in the politeness of daylight fill the grail of a new primitive. You choke on little candles and all through the night your legs cramp in the sweat of the moonlight. For no good reason a tenderness of geese is billowing in the curtains, as holes in the face open and close and paper scorches sky with futile encryption. Those armchairs foundering in the scum of the surf. Deafness craving disaster green in the spine, knowing the cocktail party’s over. Now it’s all red and your lips are trembling in believability, but it’s only a flickering image in the dark quadrant of your eye bending the light as they mow the daisies under the stars, for no good reason.

Young Gordon Walker, fledgling editor,
My daylong colleague in the corridors
Of Power & Leicht, the trade-book publishers,
Is at home to the residue in his
Acute apartment in an angle of
Abingdon Square. And they’re all there, the rear-
Guard of the garrison of Fort New York:
The skeleton defense of skinny girls
Who tap the typewriters of summertime;
The pale male workers who know no time off
Because too recently employed; the old
Manhattan hands, in patched and gin-stained tweeds;
The writers (Walker’s one), who see in their
City as desert an oasis of
Silence and time to execute their plots
Against the state of things, but fall a prey
To day succeeding day alone, and call
A party to restore themselves to all
The inside jokes of winter, in whose caul
People click, kiss like billiard balls, and fall,
Insensible, into odd pockets. Dense
As gander-feather winter snow, intense
As inextinguishable summer sun
At five o’clock (which it now is), the noise
Of Walker’s congeries of girls and boys
Foregathered in their gabbling gratitude
Strikes down the stairwell from the altitude
Of his wide-open walk-up, beckoning
Me, solo, wife gone north, to sickening
Top-story heat and talk jackhammering
Upon the anvils of all ears. “Christ, Lou, you’re here,”
Whoops Walker, topping up a jelly jar
(“Crabapple,” says the label, still stuck on)
With gin and tonic, a blue liquid smoke
That seeks its level in my unexplored
Interior, and sends back a sonar ping
To echo in my head. Two more blue gins.
The sweat that mists my glasses interdicts
My sizing up my interlocutor,
Who is, I think, the girl who lives next door,
A long-necked, fiddleheaded, celliform
Girl cellist propped on an improbably
Slim leg. Gin pings are now continuous.
The room swings in its gimbals. In the bath
Is silence, blessed, relative, untorn
By the cool drizzle of the bathtub tap,
A clear and present invitation. Like
A climber conquering K.28,
I clamber over the white porcelain
Rock face, through whitish veils of rubberized
Shower curtain, and at length, full-dressed, recline
In the encaustic crater, where a fine
Thread of cold water irrigates my feet,
To sleep, perchance to dream of winter in
The Village, fat with its full complement
Of refugees returned to their own turf—
Unspringy as it is—in a strong surf
Of retrogressing lemmings, faces fixed
On the unlovely birthplace of their mixed
Emotions, marriages, media, and met-
Aphors. Lord God of hosts, be with them yet.

My beloved little billiard balls,
my polite mongrels, edible patriotic plums,
you owe your beauty to your mother, who
resembled a cyclindrical corned beef
with all the trimmings, may God rest
her forsaken soul, for it is all of us
she forsook; and I shall never forget
her sputtering embers, and then the little mound.
Yes, my little rum runners, she had defective
tear ducts and could weep only iced tea.
She had petticoats beneath her eyelids.
And in her last years she found ball bearings
in her beehive puddings, she swore allegiance
to Abyssinia. What should I have done?
I played the piano and scrambled eggs.
I had to navigate carefully around her brain’s
avalanche lest even a decent finale be forfeited.
And her beauty still evermore. You see,
as she was dying, I led each of you to her side,
one by one she scorched you with her radiance.
And she is ever with us in our acetylene leisure.
But you are beautiful, and I, a slave to a heap of cinders.

I’m still thinking about your porch light
like a full moon casting a foggy halo
in the frigid air last night, the bare oaks
branching into the sky like nerve endings
inches away from the frozen stars,
the pink gables of your Victorian home
protesting yet another winter for you
captive in Ann Arbor as you practice
mambo by the fireplace. I’m following
your red-velvet shoes to conga beats
and bongo taps taking your body, but
not your life, from the snow mantling
your windows outside, 1,600 miles
away from Cuba. I’m tasting the cafecito
you made, the slice of homemade flan
floating in burnt sugar like the stories
you told me you can’t finish writing,
no matter how many times you travel
through time back to Havana to steal
every memory ever stolen from you.
You’re a thief anyone would forgive,
wanting only to imagine faces for names
chiseled on the graves of your family
at Guanabacoa, walk on Calle Aguacate
and pretend to meet the grandfather
you never met at his lace shop for lunch,
or pray the Kaddish like your mother
at the synagogue in El Vedado, stand
on the steps there like you once did
in a photo you can’t remember taking.
I confess I pitied you, still trying to reach
that unreachable island within the island
you still call home. I thought I was done
with Cuba, tired of filling in the blanks,
but now I’m not sure. Maybe if I return
just once more, walk the sugarcane fields
my father once cut, drive down the road
where my mother once peddled guavas
to pay for textbooks, sit on the porch
of my grandmother’s house, imagine her
still in the kitchen making arroz-con-leche—
maybe then I’ll have an answer for you
last night when you asked me: Would youmove to Cuba? Would you die there?

 Untitled, 1965, by Alberto Valdés 
I’m not easily mesmerized.
But how can you not be drawn in by swirls,
angles and whorls brought together to obey
a field of moving colors layered, muted    ...    
others bright that make you linger
there?
Just look at those Carpaccio reds.
Right then my mind
leaps to Cezanne:
his dark-blue vest in Self-Portrait (1879–1880);
the Seven Bathers (ca. 1900) wallowing in blue;
his blue beyond in Château Noir (1904).
Consider now the three, or is it four figures
in Alberto Valdés’s Untitled (ca. 1965).
They are wayward energy, moving right
to left (the right one more sensuous than the rest)
about to dive
into the deep-blue waiting — call it the unknown.
I’d like to be there when they meet that blue abyss
head on.
Will they keep their shape, I wonder,
or break up and rearrange themselves
into a brighter, more memorable pose
...    into a bigger elemental thing?
I’m really asking this:
When they run into the landscape of  blue,
will these figures lose their logic of  luster?
Will they lose their lucid argument of color,
their accumulated wealth of geometry?
Will they still engage the entire me,

PIERCE       &         CUDDIE Cuddie, for shame hold up thy heavye head, And let us cast with what delight to chace, And weary thys long lingring Phoebus race. Whilome thou wont the shepheards laddes to leade, In rymes, in ridles, and in bydding base: Now they in thee, and thou in sleepe art dead. CUDDY Piers, I have pyped erst so long with payne, That all mine Oten reedes bene rent and wore: And my poore Muse hath spent her spared store, Yet little good hath got, and much lesse gayne, Such pleasaunce makes the Grashopper so poore, And ligge so layd, when Winter doth her straine. The dapper ditties, that I wont devise, To feede youthes fancie, and the flocking fry, Delighten much: what I the bett for thy? They han the pleasure, I a sclender prise. I beate the bush, the byrds to them doe flye: What good thereof to Cuddie can arise? PIERS Cuddie, the prayse is better, then the price, The glory eke much greater then the gayne: O what an honor is it, to restraine The lust of lawlesse youth with good advice: Or pricke them forth with pleasaunce of thy vaine, Whereto thou list their trayned willes entice. Soone as thou gynst to sette thy notes in frame, O how the rurall routes to thee doe cleave: Seemeth thou dost their soule of sence bereave, All as the shepheard, that did fetch his dame From Plutoes balefull bowre withouten leave: His musicks might the hellish hound did tame. CUDDIE So praysen babes the Peacoks spotted traine, And wondren at bright Argus blazing eye: But who rewards him ere the more for thy? Or feedes him once the fuller by a graine? Sike prayse is smoke, that sheddeth in the skye, Sike words bene wynd, and wasten soone in vayne. PIERS Abandon then the base and viler clowne, Lyft up thy selfe out of the lowly dust: And sing of bloody Mars, of wars, of giusts. Turne thee to those, that weld the awful crowne, To doubted Knights, whose woundlesse armour rusts, And helmes unbruzed wexen dayly browne. There may thy Muse display her fluttryng wing, And stretch her selfe at large from East to West: Whither thou list in fayre Elisa rest, Or if thee please in bigger notes to sing, Advaunce the worthy whome shee loveth best, That first the white beare to the stake did bring. And when the stubborne stroke of stronger stounds, Has somewhat slackt the tenor of thy string: Of love and lustihed tho mayst thou sing, And carrol lowde, and leade the Myllers rownde, All were Elisa one of thilke same ring. So mought our Cuddies name to Heaven sownde. CUDDYE Indeed the Romish Tityrus, I heare, Through his Mecoenas left his Oaten reede, Whereon he earst had taught his flocks to feede, And laboured lands to yield the timely eare, And eft did sing of warres and deadly drede, So as the Heavens did quake his verse to here. But ah Mecoenas is yclad in claye, And great Augustus long ygoe is dead: And all the worthies liggen wrapt in leade, That matter made for Poets on to play: For ever, who in derring doe were dreade, The loftie verse of hem was loved aye. But after vertue gan for age to stoupe, And mighty manhode brought a bedde of ease: The vaunting Poets found nought worth a pease, To put in preace emong the learned troupe. Tho gan the streames of flowing wittes to cease, And sonnebright honour pend in shamefull coupe. And if that any buddes of Poesie, Yet of the old stocke gan to shoote agayne: Or it mens follies mote be forst to fayne, And rolle with rest in rymes of rybaudrye: Or as it sprong, it wither must agayne: Tom Piper makes us better melodie. PIERS O pierlesse Poesye, where is then thy place? If nor in Princes pallace thou doe sitt: (And yet is Princes pallace the most fitt) Ne brest of baser birth doth thee embrace. Then make thee winges of thine aspyring wit, And, whence thou camst, flye backe to heaven apace. CUDDIE Ah Percy it is all to weake and wanne, So high to sore, and make so large a flight: Her peeced pyneons bene not so in plight, For Colin fittes such famous flight to scanne: He, were he not with love so ill bedight, Would mount as high, and sing as soote as Swanne. PIERS Ah fon, for love does teach him climbe so hie, And lyftes him up out of the loathsome myre: Such immortall mirrhor, as he doth admire, Would rayse ones mynd above the starry skie. And cause a caytive corage to aspire, For lofty love doth loath a lowly eye. CUDDIE All otherwise the state of Poet stands, For lordly love is such a Tyranne fell: That where he rules, all power he doth expell. The vaunted verse a vacant head demaundes, Ne wont with crabbed care the Muses dwell. Unwisely weaves, that takes two webbes in hand. Who ever casts to compasse weightye prise, And thinks to throwe out thondring words of threate: Let powre in lavish cups and thriftie bitts of meate, For Bacchus fruite is frend to Phoebus wise. And when with Wine the braine begins to sweate, The nombers flowe as fast as spring doth ryse. Thou kenst not Percie howe the ryme should rage. O if my temples were distaind with wine, And girt in girlonds of wild Yvie twine, How I could reare the Muse on stately stage, And teache her tread aloft in buskin fine, With queint Bellona in her equipage. But ah my corage cooles ere it be warme, For thy, content us in thys humble shade: Where no such troublous tydes han us assayde, Here we our slender pipes may safely charme.

A tool for piercing holes. Particularly in leather. A simple metal shaft. A knob of wood for handle, polished by its fit in the sinewy cradle of a leather-worker’s  palm. Likely the tool with which Louis Braille blinded himself as a child in France. An accident in his father’s saddle-making shop in the early years of the nineteenth century. Braille later invented a system of raised dots as a means of reading and writing for the blind. We don’t know much. Whether he was in the shop with his father or snuck in alone. Whether it was damp and rainy or whether the sun shone and brought to life the floating dust that always hung in the workshop air. Maybe it was just a little poke in the eye. A small tool, a small slip of the hand, a small injury. How a little fumble ends in blindness. It was decades before general anesthetic or antiseptics. Perhaps the doctor they rushed him to believed in the value of “laudable pus” in a wound. I don’t want to picture it. As a child, playing in his father’s saddle-making shop, did Louis Braille already know the names of the parts of a saddle—cantle, pommel, stirrup, tree? Did he know the smell and feel of each grade of leather? Of all the tools—punch and pincers, gouge and groover, chisel and awl—he chose awl. Likely the last thing he saw, a shine of metal galloping toward his eye. Is it accident that my tool for pressing hand-punched Braille is so much like a blunt, very small awl?

Never anymore in a wash of sweetness and awe  does the summer when I was seventeen come back  to mind against my will, like a bird crossing  my vision. Summer of moist nights full of girls  and boys ripened, holy drunkenness and violation  of the comic boundaries, defiances that never  failed or brought disaster. Days on the backs  and in the breath of horses, between rivers  and pools that reflected the cicadas' whine,  enervation and strength creeping in smooth waves  over muscular water. All those things accepted,  once, with unnoticing hunger, as an infant  accepts the nipple, never come back to mind  against the will. What comes unsummoned now,  blotting out every other thought and image,  is a part of the past not so deep or far away:  the time of poverty, of struggle to find means  not hateful—the muddy seedtime of early manhood.  What returns are those moments in the diner  night after night with each night's one cup of coffee,  watching an old man, who always at the same hour  came in and smiled, ordered his tea and opened  his drawing pad. What did he fill it with?  And where's he gone? Those days, that studious worker,  hand moving and eyes eager in the sour light,  that artist always in the same worn-out suit,  are my nostalgia now. That old man comes back,  the friend I saw each day and never spoke to,  because I hoped soon to disappear from there,  as I have disappeared, into the heaven of better days.

In pious times, ere priest-craft did begin,Before polygamy was made a sin;When man, on many, multipli'd his kind,Ere one to one was cursedly confin'd:When Nature prompted, and no Law deni'dPromiscuous use of concubine and bride;Then, Israel's monarch, after Heaven's own heart,His vigorous warmth did variously impartTo wives and slaves: and, wide as his command,Scatter'd his Maker's image through the land.Michal, of royal blood, the crown did wear;A soil ungrateful to the tiller's care:Not so the rest; for several mothers boreTo god-like David, several sons before.But since like slaves his bed they did ascend,No true succession could their seed attend.Of all this numerous progeny was noneSo beautiful, so brave, as Absalom:Whether, inspir'd by some diviner lust,His father got him with a greater gust;Or that his conscious destiny made way,By manly beauty to imperial sway.Early in foreign fields he won renown,With kings and states alli'd to Israel's crown:In peace the thoughts of war he could remove,And seem'd as he were only born for love.Whate'er he did, was done with so much ease,In him alone, 'twas natural to please:His motions all accompani'd with grace;And Paradise was open'd in his face.With secret joy, indulgent David view'dHis youthful image in his son renew'd:To all his wishes nothing he deni'd;And made the charming Annabel his bride.What faults he had (for who from faults is free?)His father could not, or he would not see.Some warm excesses, which the Law forbore,Were constru'd youth that purged by boiling o'er:And Amnon's murther, by a specious name,Was call'd a just revenge for injur'd fame.Thus prais'd, and lov'd, the noble youth remain'd,While David, undisturb'd, in Sion reign'd.But life can never be sincerely blest:Heav'n punishes the bad, and proves the best.The Jews, a headstrong, moody, murm'ring race,As ever tri'd th'extent and stretch of grace;God's pamper'd people whom, debauch'd with ease,No king could govern, nor no God could please;(Gods they had tri'd of every shape and size,That god-smiths could produce, or priests devise:)These Adam-wits, too fortunately free,Began to dream they wanted liberty:And when no rule, no precedent, was foundOf men, by laws less circumscrib'd and bound,They led their wild desires to woods and caves,And thought that all but savages were slaves.They who, when Saul was dead, without a blow,Made foolish Ishbosheth the crown forego;Who banisht David did from Hebron bring,And, with a general shout, proclaim'd him king:Those very Jews, who, at their very best,Their Humour more than loyalty exprest,Now, wonder'd why, so long, they had obey'dAn idol-monarch which their hands had made:Thought they might ruin him they could create;Or melt him to that golden calf, a state.But these were random bolts: no form'd design,Nor interest made the factious crowd to join:The sober part of Israel, free from stain,Well knew the value of a peaceful reign:And, looking backward with a wise afright,Saw seams of wounds, dishonest to the sight:In contemplation of whose ugly scars,They curst the memory of civil wars.The moderate sort of men, thus qualifi'd,Inclin'd the balance to the better side:And, David's mildness manag'd it so well,The bad found no occasion to rebel.But, when to sin our bias'd nature leans,The careful Devil is still at hand with means;And providently pimps for ill desires:The good old cause reviv'd, a plot requires.Plots, true or false, are necessary things,To raise up common-wealths, and ruin kings.
  Th' inhabitants of old JerusalemWere Jebusites: the town so call'd from them;And theirs the native right—But when the chosen people grew more strong,The rightful cause at length became the wrong:And every loss the men of Jebus bore,They still were thought God's enemies the more.Thus, worn and weaken'd, well or ill content,Submit they must to David's government:Impoverish'd and depriv'd of all command,Their taxes doubled as they lost their land;And, what was harder yet to flesh and blood,Their gods disgrac'd, and burnt like common wood.This set the heathen priesthood in a flame;For priests of all religions are the same:Of whatsoe'er descent their godhead be,Stock, stone, or other homely pedigree,In his defence his servants are as bold,As if he had been born of beaten gold.The Jewish Rabbins though their Enemies,In this conclude them honest men and wise:For 'twas their duty, all the learned think,T'espouse his cause by whom they eat and drink.From hence began that plot, the nation's curse,Bad in itself, but represented worse.Rais'd in extremes, and in extremes decri'd;With oaths affirm'd, with dying vows deni'd.Not weigh'd, or winnow'd by the multitude;But swallow'd in the mass, unchew'd and crude.Some truth there was, but dash'd and brew'd with lies;To please the fools, and puzzle all the wise.Succeeding times did equal folly call,Believing nothing, or believing all.Th' Egyptian rites the Jebusites embrac'd;Where gods were recommended by their taste.Such sav'ry deities must needs be good,As serv'd at once for worship and for food.By force they could not introduce these gods;For ten to one, in former days was odds.So fraud was us'd, (the sacrificers' trade,)Fools are more hard to conquer than persuade.Their busy teachers mingled with the Jews;And rak'd, for converts, even the court and stews:Which Hebrew priests the more unkindly took,Because the fleece accompanies the flock.Some thought they God's anointed meant to slayBy guns, invented since full many a day:Our author swears it not; but who can knowHow far the Devil and Jebusites may go?This plot, which fail'd for want of common sense,Had yet a deep and dangerous consequence:For, as when raging fevers boil the blood,The standing lake soon floats into a flood;And ev'ry hostile humour, which beforeSlept quiet in its channels, bubbles o'er:So, several factions from this first ferment,Work up to foam, and threat the government.Some by their friends, more by themselves thought wise,Oppos'd the pow'r, to which they could not rise.Some had in courts been great, and thrown from thence,Like fiends, were harden'd in impenitence.Some by their monarch's fatal mercy grown,From pardon'd rebels, kinsmen to the throne;Were rais'd in pow'r and public office high;Strong bands, if bands ungrateful men could tie.
  Of these the false Achitophel was first:A name to all succeeding ages curst.For close designs, and crooked counsels fit;Sagacious, bold and turbulent of wit:Restless, unfixt in principles and place;In pow'r unpleas'd, impatient of disgrace.A fiery soul, which working out its way,Fretted the pigmy-body to decay:And o'er inform'd the tenement of clay.A daring pilot in extremity;Pleas'd with the danger, when the waves went highHe sought the storms; but for a calm unfit,Would steer too nigh the sands, to boast his wit.Great wits are sure to madness near alli'd;And thin partitions do their bounds divide:Else, why should he, with wealth and honour blest,Refuse his age the needful hours of rest?Punish a body which he could not please;Bankrupt of life, yet prodigal of ease?And all to leave, what with his toil he wonTo that unfeather'd, two-legg'd thing, a son:Got, while his soul did huddled notions try;And born a shapeless lump, like anarchy.In friendship false, implacable in hate:Resolv'd to ruin or to rule the state.To compass this, the triple bond he broke;The pillars of the public safety shook:And fitted Israel for a foreign yoke.Then, seiz'd with fear, yet still affecting fame,Usurp'd a patriot's all-atoning name.So easy still it proves in factious times,With public zeal to cancel private crimes:How safe is treason, and how sacred ill,Where none can sin against the people's will:Where crowds can wink; and no offence be known,Since in another's guilt they find their own.Yet, fame deserv'd, no enemy can grudge;The statesman we abhor, but praise the judge.In Jewish courts ne'er sat an AbbethdinWith more discerning eyes, or hands more clean:Unbrib'd, unsought, the wretched to redress;Swift of dispatch, and easy of access.Oh, had he been content to serve the crown,With virtues only proper to the gown;Or, had the rankness of the soil been freedFrom cockle, that opprest the noble seed:David, for him his tuneful harp had strung,And heav'n had wanted one immortal song.But wild ambition loves to slide, not stand;And fortune's ice prefers to virtue's land:Achitophel, grown weary to possessA lawful fame, and lazy happiness;Disdain'd the golden fruit to gather free,And lent the crowd his arm to shake the tree.Now, manifest of crimes, contriv'd long since,He stood at bold defiance with his prince:Held up the buckler of the people's cause,Against the crown; and skulk'd behind the laws.The wish'd occasion of the plot he takes;Some circumstances finds, but more he makes.By buzzing emissaries, fills the earsOf list'ning crowds, with jealousies and fearsOf arbitrary counsels brought to light,And proves the king himself a Jebusite.Weak arguments! which yet he knew full well,Were strong with people easy to rebel.For, govern'd by the moon, the giddy JewsTread the same track when she the prime renews:And once in twenty years, their scribes record,By natural instinct they change their lord.Achitophel still wants a chief, and noneWas found so fit as warlike Absalom:Not, that he wish'd his greatness to create,(For politicians neither love nor hate:)But, for he knew, his title not allow'd,Would keep him still depending on the crowd:That kingly pow'r, thus ebbing out, might beDrawn to the dregs of a democracy.Him he attempts, with studied arts to please,And sheds his venom, in such words as these.
  Auspicious Prince! at whose nativitySome royal planet rul'd the southern sky;Thy longing country's darling and desire;Their cloudy pillar, and their guardian fire:Their second Moses, whose extended wandDivides the seas, and shows the promis'd land:Whose dawning day, in very distant age,Has exercis'd the sacred prophet's rage:The people's pray'r, the glad diviner's theme,The young men's vision, and the old men's dream!Thee, Saviour, thee, the nation's vows confess;And, never satisfi'd with seeing, bless:Swift, unbespoken pomps, thy steps proclaim,And stammering babes are taught to lisp thy name.How long wilt thou the general joy detain;Starve, and defraud the people of thy reign?Content ingloriously to pass thy daysLike one of virtue's fools that feeds on praise;Till thy fresh glories, which now shine so bright,Grow stale and tarnish with our daily sight.Believe me, royal youth, thy fruit must be,Or gather'd ripe, or rot upon the tree.Heav'n has to all allotted, soon or late,Some lucky revolution of their fate:Whose motions if we watch and guide with skill,(For human good depends on human will,)Our fortune rolls, as from a smooth descent,And, from the first impression, takes the bent:But, if unseiz'd, she glides away like wind;And leaves repenting folly far behind.Now, now she meets you, with a glorious prize,And spreads her locks before her as she flies.Had thus Old David, from whose loins you spring,Not dar'd, when fortune call'd him, to be king.At Gath an exile he might still remain;And Heaven's anointing oil had been in vain.Let his successful youth your hopes engage;But shun th'example of declining age:Behold him setting in his western skies,The shadows lengthening as the vapours rise.He is not now, as when on Jordan's sandThe joyful people throng'd to see him land,Cov'ring the beach, and black'ning all the strand:But, like the Prince of Angels from his height,Comes tumbling downward with diminish'd light:Betray'd by one poor plot to public scorn:(Our only blessing since his curst return:)Those heaps of people which one sheaf did bind,Blown off, and scatter'd by a puff of wind.What strength can he to your designs oppose,Naked of friends and round beset with foes?If Pharaoh's doubtful succour he should use,A foreign aid would more incense the Jews:Proud Egypt would dissembled friendship bring;Foment the war, but not support the king:Nor would the royal party e'er uniteWith Pharaoh's arms, t'assist the Jebusite;Or if they should, their interest soon would break,And with such odious aid, make David weak.All sorts of men, by my successful arts,Abhorring kings, estrange their alter'd heartsFrom David's rule: And 'tis the general Cry,Religion, Common-wealth, and Liberty.If, you, as champion of the public good,Add to their arms a chief of royal blood;What may not Israel hope, and what applauseMight such a general gain by such a cause?Not barren praise alone, that gaudy flow'r,Fair only to the sight, but solid pow'r:And nobler is a limited command,Giv'n by the love of all your native land,Than a successive title, long, and dark,Drawn from the mouldy rolls of Noah's Ark.
  What cannot praise effect in mighty minds,When flattery soothes, and when ambition blinds!Desire of pow'r, on earth a vicious weed,Yet, sprung from high, is of celestial seed:In God 'tis glory: And when men aspire,'Tis but a spark too much of heavenly fire.Th' ambitious youth, too covetous of fame,Too full of angel's metal in his frame;Unwarily was led from virtue's ways;Made drunk with honour, and debauch'd with praise.Half loath, and half consenting to the ill,(For loyal blood within him struggled still)He thus repli'd.—And what pretence have ITo take up arms for public liberty?My Father governs with unquestion'd right;The Faith's defender, and mankind's delight:Good, gracious, just, observant of the laws;And Heav'n by wonders has espous'd his cause.Whom has he wrong'd in all his peaceful reign?Who sues for justice to his throne in vain?What millions has he pardon'd of his foes,Whom just revenge did to his wrath expose?Mild, easy, humble, studious of our good;Inclin'd to mercy, and averse from blood.If mildness ill with stubborn Israel suit,His crime is God's beloved attribute.What could he gain, his people to betray,Or change his right, for arbitrary sway?Let haughty Pharaoh curse with such a reign,His fruitful Nile, and yoke a servile train.If David's rule Jerusalem displease,The Dog-star heats their brains to this disease.Why then should I, encouraging the bad,Turn rebel, and run popularly mad?Were he a tyrant who, by lawless might,Oppress'd the Jews, and rais'd the Jebusite,Well might I mourn; but nature's holy bandsWould curb my spirits, and restrain my hands:The people might assert their liberty;But what was right in them, were crime in me.His favour leaves me nothing to require;Prevents my wishes, and out-runs desire.What more can I expect while David lives?All but his kingly diadem he gives:And that: but there he paus'd; then sighing, said,Is justly destin'd for a worthier head.For when my father from his toils shall rest,And late augment the number of the blest:His lawful issue shall the throne ascend;Or the collat'ral line where that shall end.His brother, though oppress'd with vulgar spite,Yet dauntless and secure of native right,Of every royal virtue stands possess'd;Still dear to all the bravest, and the best.His courage foes, his friends his truth proclaim;His loyalty the king, the world his fame.His mercy ev'n th'offending crowd will find:For sure he comes of a forgiving kind.Why should I then repine at Heaven's decree;Which gives me no pretence to royalty?Yet oh that Fate, propitiously inclin'd,Had rais'd my birth, or had debas'd my mind;To my large soul, not all her treasure lent,And then betray'd it to a mean descent.I find, I find my mounting spirits bold,And David's part disdains my mother's mold.Why am I scanted by a niggard-birth?My soul disclaims the kindred of her earth:And made for empire, whispers me within;Desire of greatness is a god-like sin.
  Him staggering so when Hell's dire agent found,While fainting virtue scarce maintain'd her ground,He pours fresh forces in, and thus replies:
  Th'eternal God, supremely good and wise,Imparts not these prodigious gifts in vain;What wonders are reserv'd to bless your reign?Against your will your arguments have shown,Such virtue's only giv'n to guide a throne.Not that your father's mildness I contemn;But manly force becomes the diadem.'Tis true, he grants the people all they crave;And more perhaps than subjects ought to have:For lavish grants suppose a monarch tame,And more his goodness than his wit proclaim.But when should people strive their bonds to break,If not when kings are negligent or weak?Let him give on till he can give no more,The thrifty Sanhedrin shall keep him poor:And every shekel which he can receive,Shall cost a limb of his prerogative.To ply him with new plots, shall be my care;Or plunge him deep in some expensive war;Which, when his treasure can no more supply,He must, with the remains of kingship, buy.His faithful friends, our jealousies and fearsCall Jebusites; and Pharaoh's pensioners:Whom, when our fury from his aid has torn,He shall be naked left to public scorn.The next successor, whom I fear and hate,My arts have made obnoxious to the state;Turn'd all his virtues to his overthrow,And gain'd our elders to pronounce a foe.His right, for sums of necessary gold,Shall first be pawn'd, and afterwards be sold:Till time shall ever-wanting David draw,To pass your doubtful title into law:If not; the people have a right supremeTo make their kings; for kings are made for them.All empire is no more than pow'r in trust:Which when resum'd, can be no longer just.Succession, for the general good design'd,In its own wrong a nation cannot bind:If altering that, the people can relieve,Better one suffer, than a nation grieve.The Jews well know their pow'r: ere Saul they chose,God was their king, and God they durst depose.Urge now your piety, your filial name,A father's right, and fear of future fame;The public good, the universal call,To which even Heav'n submitted, answers all.Nor let his love enchant your generous mind;'Tis Nature's trick to propagate her kind.Our fond begetters, who would never die,Love but themselves in their posterity.Or let his kindness by th'effects be tri'd,Or let him lay his vain pretence aside.God said he lov'd your father; could he bringA better proof, than to anoint him king?It surely show'd he lov'd the shepherd well,Who gave so fair a flock as Israel.Would David have you thought his darling son?What means he then, to alienate the crown?The name of godly he may blush to bear:'Tis after God's own heart to cheat his heir.He to his brother gives supreme command;To you a legacy of barren land:Perhaps th'old harp, on which he thrums his lays:Or some dull Hebrew ballad in your praise.Then the next heir, a prince, severe and wiseAlready looks on you with jealous eyes;Sees through the thin disguises of your arts,And marks your progress in the people's hearts.Though now his mighty soul in grief contains,He meditates revenge who least complains;And like a lion, slumb'ring in the way,Or sleep-dissembling, while he waits his prey,His fearless foes within his distance draws;Constrains his roaring and contracts his paws:Till at the last, his time for fury found,He shoots with sudden vengeance from the ground:The prostrate vulgar, passes o'er, and spares;But with a lordly rage, his hunters tears.Your case no tame expedients will afford;Resolve on death, or conquest by the sword,Which for no less a stake than life, you draw;And self-defence is Nature's eldest law.Leave the warm people no considering time;For then rebellion may be thought a crime.Prevail yourself of what occasion gives,But try your title while your father lives:And that your arms may have a fair pretence,Proclaim, you take them in the king's defence:Whose sacred life each minute would exposeTo plots from seeming friends and secret foes.And who can sound the depth of David's soul?Perhaps his fear, his kindness may control.He fears his brother, though he loves his son,For plighted vows too late to be undone.If so, by force he wishes to be gain'd;Like women's lechery, to seem constrain'd:Doubt not; but when he most affects the frown,Commit a pleasing rape upon the crown.Secure his person to secure your cause;They who possess the prince, possess the laws.
  He said, and this advice above the restWith Absalom's mild nature suited best;Unblam'd of life, (ambition set aside,)Not stain'd with cruelty, nor puff'd with pride.How happy had he been, if destinyHad higher plac'd his birth, or not so high!His kingly virtues might have claim'd a throne;And blest all other countries but his own:But charming greatness since so few refuse,'Tis juster to lament him, than accuse.Strong were his hopes a rival to remove,With blandishments to gain the public love;To head the faction while their zeal was hot,And popularly prosecute the plot.To farther this Achitophel unitesThe malcontents of all the Israelites:Whose differing parties he could wisely join,For several ends, to serve the same design.The best, and of the princes some were such,Who thought the pow'r of monarchy too much:Mistaken men, and patriots in their hearts;Not wicked, but seduc'd by impious arts.By these the springs of property were bent,And wound so high, they crack'd the government.The next for interest sought t'embroil the state,To sell their duty at a dearer rate;And make their Jewish markets of the throne;Pretending public good, to serve their own.Others thought kings an useless heavy load,Who cost too much, and did too little good.These were for laying honest David by,On principles of pure good husbandry.With them join'd all th'haranguers of the throng,That thought to get preferment by the tongue.Who follow next, a double danger bring,Not only hating David, but the king;The Solymaean rout; well vers'd of oldIn godly faction, and in treason bold;Cow'ring and quaking at a conqu'ror's sword,But lofty to a lawful prince restor'd;Saw with disdain an Ethnic plot begun,And scorn'd by Jebusites to be out-done.Hot Levites headed these; who pull'd beforeFrom th'Ark, which in the Judges' days they bore,Resum'd their Cant, and with a zealous cry,Pursu'd their old belov'd Theocracy.Where Sanhedrin and Priest enslav'd the nation,And justifi'd their spoils by inspiration:For who so fit for reign as Aaron's race,If once dominion they could found in Grace?These led the pack; though not of surest scent,Yet deepest mouth'd against the government.A numerous host of dreaming saints succeed;Of the true old enthusiastic breed:'Gainst form and order they their pow'r employ;Nothing to build, and all things to destroy.But far more numerous was the herd of such,Who think too little, and who talk too much.These, out of mere instinct, they knew not why,Ador'd their father's God, and property:And by the same blind benefit of fate,The Devil and the Jebusite did hate:Born to be saved even in their own despite;Because they could not help believing right.Such were the tools; but a whole Hydra moreRemains, of sprouting heads too long, to score.Some of their chiefs were princes of the land:In the first rank of these did Zimri stand:A man so various, that he seem'd to beNot one, but all Mankind's Epitome.Stiff in opinions, always in the wrong;Was everything by starts, and nothing long:But in the course of one revolving moon,Was chemist, fiddler, statesman, and buffoon:Then all for women, painting, rhyming, drinking;Besides ten thousand freaks that died in thinking.Blest madman, who could every hour employ,With something new to wish, or to enjoy!Railing and praising were his usual themes;And both (to show his judgment) in extremes:So over violent, or over civil,That every man, with him, was god or devil.In squandering wealth was his peculiar art:Nothing went unrewarded, but desert.Beggar'd by fools, whom still he found too late:He had his jest, and they had his estate.He laugh'd himself from court; then sought reliefBy forming parties, but could ne'er be chief:For, spite of him, the weight of business fellOn Absalom and wise Achitophel:Thus, wicked but in will, of means bereft,He left not faction, but of that was left.
  Titles and names 'twere tedious to rehearseOf lords, below the dignity of verse.Wits, warriors, commonwealths-men, were the best:Kind husbands and mere nobles all the rest.And, therefore in the name of dullness, beThe well-hung Balaam and cold Caleb free.And canting Nadab let oblivion damn,Who made new porridge for the Paschal Lamb.Let friendship's holy band some names assure:Some their own worth, and some let scorn secure.Nor shall the rascal rabble here have place,Whom kings no titles gave, and God no grace:Not bull-faced Jonas, who could statutes drawTo mean rebellion, and make treason law.But he, though bad, is follow'd by a worse,The wretch, who Heav'n's Anointed dar'd to curse.Shimei, whose youth did early promise bringOf zeal to God, and hatred to his king;Did wisely from expensive sins refrain,And never broke the Sabbath, but for gain:Nor ever was he known an oath to vent,Or curse, unless against the government.Thus, heaping wealth, by the most ready wayAmong the Jews, which was to cheat and pray;The city, to reward his pious hateAgainst his master, chose him magistrate:His hand a vare of justice did uphold;His neck was loaded with a chain of gold.During his office, treason was no crime.The sons of Belial had a glorious time:For Shimei, though not prodigal of pelf,Yet lov'd his wicked neighbour as himself:When two or three were gather'd to declaimAgainst the monarch of Jerusalem,Shimei was always in the midst of them.And, if they curst the king when he was by,Would rather curse, than break good company.If any durst his factious friends accuse,He pack'd a jury of dissenting Jews:Whose fellow-feeling, in the godly cause,Would free the suff'ring saint from human laws.For laws are only made to punish thoseWho serve the king, and to protect his foes.If any leisure time he had from pow'r,(Because 'tis sin to mis-employ an hour;)His bus'ness was, by writing, to persuade,That kings were useless, and a clog to trade:And, that his noble style he might refine,No Rechabite more shunn'd the fumes of wine.Chaste were his cellars; and his shrieval boardThe grossness of a city feast abhorr'd:His cooks, with long disuse, their trade forgot;Cool was his kitchen, though his brains were hot.Such frugal virtue malice may accuse;But sure 'twas necessary to the Jews:For towns once burnt, such magistrates requireAs dare not tempt God's providence by fire.With spiritual food he fed his servants well,But free from flesh, that made the Jews rebel:And Moses' laws he held in more accountFor forty days of fasting in the mount.To speak the rest, who better are forgot,Would tire a well-breath'd witness of the plot:Yet, Corah, thou shalt from oblivion pass;Erect thyself thou monumental brass:High as the serpent of thy metal made,While nations stand secure beneath thy shade.What though his birth were base, yet comets riseFrom earthy vapours e'er they shine in skies.Prodigious actions may as well be doneBy weaver's issue, as by prince's son.This arch-attestor, for the public good,By that one deed ennobles all his blood.Who ever ask'd the witnesses' high race,Whose oath with martyrdom did Stephen grace?Ours was a Levite, and as times went then,His tribe were God-almighty's gentlemen.Sunk were his eyes, his voice was harsh and loud,Sure signs he neither choleric was, nor proud:His long chin prov'd his wit; his saint-like graceA church vermilion, and a Moses' face.His memory, miraculously great,Could plots exceeding man's belief, repeat;Which therefore cannot be accounted lies,For human wit could never such devise.Some future truths are mingled in his book;But, where the witness fail'd, the Prophet spoke:Some things like visionary flights appear;The spirit caught him up, the Lord knows where:And gave him his rabbinical degree,Unknown to foreign university.His judgment yet his mem'ry did excel:Which piec'd his wondrous evidence so well:And suited to the temper of the times;Then groaning under Jebusitic crimes.Let Israel's foes suspect his Heav'nly call,And rashly judge his writ apocryphal;Our laws for such affronts have forfeits made:He takes his life, who takes away his trade.Were I myself in witness Corah's place,The wretch who did me such a dire disgrace,Should whet my memory, though once forgot,To make him an appendix of my plot.His zeal to Heav'n made him his prince despise,And load his person with indignities:But Zeal peculiar privilege affords,Indulging latitude to deeds and words.And Corah might for Agag's murther call,In terms as coarse as Samuel us'd to Saul.What others in his evidence did join,(The best that could be had for love or coin,)In Corah's own predicament will fall:For Witness is a common name to all.
  Surrounded thus with friends of every sort,Deluded Absalom forsakes the court:Impatient of high hopes, urg'd with renown,And fir'd with near possession of a crown:Th' admiring crowd are dazzled with surprise,And on his goodly person feed their eyes:His joy conceal'd, he sets himself to show;On each side bowing popularly low:His looks, his gestures, and his words he frames,And with familiar ease repeats their names.Thus, form'd by Nature, furnish'd out with arts,He glides unfelt into their secret hearts:Then, with a kind compassionating look,And sighs, bespeaking pity e'er he spoke:Few words he said; but easy those and fit:More slow than Hybla drops, and far more sweet.
  I mourn, my country-men, your lost estate;Though far unable to prevent your fate:Behold a banish'd man, for your dear causeExpos'd a prey to arbitrary laws!Yet oh! that I alone could be undone,Cut off from empire, and no more a son!Now all your liberties a spoil are made;Egypt and Tyrus intercept your trade,And Jebusites your sacred rites invade.My father, whom with reverence yet I name,Charm'd into ease, is careless of his fame:And, brib'd with petty sums of foreign gold,Is grown in Bathsheba's embraces old:Exalts his enemies, his friends destroys:And all his pow'r against himself employs.He gives, and let him give my right away:But why should he his own, and yours betray?He, only he can make the nation bleed,And he alone from my revenge is freed.Take then my tears (with that he wip'd his eyes)'Tis all the aid my present pow'r supplies:No court-informer can these arms accuse;These arms may sons against their fathers use;And, 'tis my wish, the next successor's reignMay make no other Israelite complain.
  Youth, beauty, graceful action, seldom fail:But common interest always will prevail:And pity never ceases to be shownTo him, who makes the people's wrongs his own.The crowd, (that still believe their kings oppress,)With lifted hands their young Messiah bless:Who now begins his progress to ordain;With chariots, horsemen, and a num'rous train:From East to West his glories he displays:And, like the sun, the Promis'd Land surveys.Fame runs before him, as the Morning-Star;And shouts of joy salute him from afar:Each house receives him as a guardian God;And consecrates the place of his abode:But hospitable treats did most commendWise Issachar, his wealthy western friend.This moving court, that caught the people's eyes,And seem'd but pomp, did other ends disguise:Achitophel had form'd it, with intentTo sound the depths, and fathom where it went,The people's hearts; distinguish friends from foes;And try their strength, before they came to blows.Yet all was colour'd with a smooth pretenceOf specious love, and duty to their prince.Religion, and redress of grievances,Two names, that always cheat and always please,Are often urg'd; and good King David's lifeEndanger'd by a brother and a wife.Thus, in a pageant show, a plot is made;And peace itself is war in masquerade.Oh foolish Israel! never warn'd by ill:Still the same bait, and circumvented still!Did ever men forsake their present ease,In midst of health imagine a disease;Take pains contingent mischiefs to foresee,Make heirs for monarchs, and for God decree?What shall we think! Can people give awayBoth for themselves and sons, their native sway?Then they are left defenceless to the swordOf each unbounded arbitrary lord:And laws are vain, by which we right enjoy,If kings unquestion'd can those laws destroy.Yet, if the crowd be judge of fit and just,And kings are only officers in trust,Then this resuming cov'nant was declar'dWhen Kings were made, or is for ever bar'd:If those who gave the sceptre could not tieBy their own deed their own posterity,How then could Adam bind his future race?How could his forfeit on mankind take place?Or how could heavenly justice damn us all,Who ne'er consented to our father's fall?Then kings are slaves to those whom they command,And tenants to their people's pleasure stand.Add, that the pow'r for property allow'd,Is mischievously seated in the crowd:For who can be secure of private right,If sovereign sway may be dissolv'd by might?Nor is the people's judgment always true:The most may err as grossly as the few.And faultless kings run down, by common cry,For vice, oppression and for tyranny.What standard is there in a fickle rout,Which, flowing to the mark, runs faster out?Nor only crowds, but Sanhedrins may beInfected with this public lunacy:And share the madness of rebellious times,To murther monarchs for imagin'd crimes.If they may give and take whene'er they please,Not kings alone, (the godhead's images,)But government itself at length must fallTo nature's state, where all have right to all.Yet, grant our lords the people kings can make,What prudent men a settled throne would shake?For whatsoe'er their sufferings were before,That change they covet makes them suffer more.All other errors but disturb a state;But innovation is the blow of fate.If ancient fabrics nod, and threat to fall,To patch the flaws, and buttress up the wall,Thus far 'tis duty; but here fix the mark:For all beyond it is to touch our Ark.To change foundations, cast the frame anew,Is work for rebels who base ends pursue:At once divine and human laws control;And mend the parts by ruin of the whole.The tamp'ring world is subject to this curse,To physic their disease into a worse.
  Now what relief can righteous David bring?How fatal 'tis to be too good a king!Friends he has few, so high the madness grows;Who dare be such, must be the people's foes:Yet some there were, ev'n in the worst of days;Some let me name, and naming is to praise.
  In this short file Barzillai first appears;Barzillai crown'd with honour and with years:Long since, the rising rebels he withstoodIn regions waste, beyond the Jordan's flood:Unfortunately brave to buoy the state;But sinking underneath his master's fate:In exile with his god-like prince he mourn'd:For him he suffer'd, and with him return'd.The court he practis'd, not the courtier's art:Large was his wealth, but larger was his heart:Which well the noblest objects knew to choose,The fighting warrior, and recording Muse.His bed could once a fruitful issue boast:Now more than half a father's name is lost.His eldest hope, with every grace adorn'd,By me (so Heav'n will have it) always mourn'd,And always honour'd, snatch'd in manhood's primeB' unequal Fates, and Providence's crime:Yet not before the goal of honour won,All parts fulfill'd, of subject and of son;Swift was the race, but short the time to run.Oh narrow circle, but of pow'r divine,Scanted in space, but perfect in thy line!By sea, by land, thy matchless worth was known;Arms thy delight, and war was all thy own:Thy force infus'd, the fainting Tyrians propp'd:And haughty Pharaoh found his fortune stopp'd.Oh ancient honour, Oh unconquer'd Hand,Whom foes unpunish'd never could withstand!But Israel was unworthy of thy name:Short is the date of all immoderate fame.It looks as Heav'n our ruin had design'd,And durst not trust thy fortune and thy mind.Now, free from earth, thy disencumber'd SoulMounts up, and leaves behind the clouds and starry pole:From thence thy kindred legions may'st thou bring,To aid the Guardian Angel of thy king.Here stop my Muse, here cease thy painful flight;No pinions can pursue immortal height:Tell good Barzillai thou canst sing no more,And tell thy soul she should have fled before;Or fled she with his life, and left this verseTo hang on her departed patron's hearse?Now take thy steepy flight from Heav'n, and seeIf thou canst find on earth another he;Another he would be too hard to find,See then whom thou canst see not far behind.Zadoc the priest whom, shunning, pow'r and place,His lowly mind advanc'd to David's grace:With him the Sagan of Jerusalem,Of hospitable soul and noble stem;Him of the western dome, whose weighty senseFlows in fit words and heavenly eloquence.The Prophet's sons by such example led,To learning and to loyalty were bred:For colleges on bounteous kings depend,And never rebel was to arts a friend.To these succeed the pillars of the laws,Who best could plead, and best can judge a cause.Next them a train of loyal peers ascend:Sharp judging Adriel, the Muse's friend,Himself a Muse:—in Sanhedrin's debateTrue to his prince; but not a slave of state.Whom David's love with honours did adorn,That from his disobedient son were torn.Jotham of piercing wit and pregnant thought,Endow'd by Nature, and by learning taughtTo move assemblies, who but only tri'dThe worse awhile, then chose the better side;Nor chose alone, but turn'd the balance too;So much the weight of one brave man can do.Hushai, the friend of David in distress,In public storms of manly steadfastness;By foreign treaties he inform'd his youth;And join'd experience to his native truth.His frugal care suppli'd the wanting throne;Frugal for that, but bounteous of his own:'Tis easy conduct when exchequers flow;But hard the task to manage well the low:For sovereign power is too depress'd or high,When kings are forc'd to sell, or crowds to buy.Indulge one labour more, my weary Muse,For Amiel, who can Amiel's praise refuse?Of ancient race by birth, but nobler yetIn his own worth, and without title great:The Sanhedrin long time as chief he rul'd,Their reason guided, and their passion cool'd;So dext'rous was he in the crown's defence,So form'd to speak a loyal nation's sense,That as their band was Israel's tribes in small,So fit was he to represent them all.Now rasher charioteers the seat ascend,Whose loose careers his steady skill commend:They, like th'unequal ruler of the day,Misguide the seasons and mistake the way;While he withdrawn at their mad labour smiles,And safe enjoys the sabbath of his toils.
  These were the chief; a small but faithful bandOf worthies, in the breach who dar'd to stand,And tempt th'united fury of the land.With grief they view'd such powerful engines bent,To batter down the lawful government.A numerous faction with pretended frights,In Sanhedrins to plume the regal rights.The true successor from the court remov'd:The plot, by hireling witnesses, improv'd.These ills they saw, and as their duty bound,They show'd the king the danger of the wound:That no concessions from the throne would please;But lenitives fomented the disease:That Absalom, ambitious of the crown,Was made the lure to draw the people down:That false Achitophel's pernicious hate,Had turn'd the plot to ruin church and state:The Council violent, the rabble worse:That Shimei taught Jerusalem to curse.
  With all these loads of injuries opprest,And long revolving in his careful breastTh'event of things; at last his patience tir'd,Thus from his royal throne, by Heav'n inspir'd,The god-like David spoke; and awful fearHis train their Maker in their Master hear.
  Thus long have I by native mercy sway'd,My wrongs dissembl'd, my revenge delay'd:So willing to forgive th'offending age;So much the father did the king assuage.But now so far my clemency they slight,Th' offenders question my forgiving right.That one was made for many, they contend:But 'tis to rule, for that's a monarch's end.They call my tenderness of blood, my fear:Though manly tempers can the longest bear.Yet, since they will divert my native course,'Tis time to shew I am not good by force.Those heap'd affronts that haughty subjects bring,Are burdens for a camel, not a king:Kings are the public pillars of the state,Born to sustain and prop the nation's weight:If my young Sampson will pretend a callTo shake the column, let him share the fall:But oh that yet he would repent and live!How easy 'tis for parents to forgive!With how few tears a pardon might be wonFrom Nature, pleading for a darling son!Poor pitied youth, by my paternal care,Rais'd up to all the heights his frame could bear:Had God ordain'd his fate for empire born,He would have giv'n his soul another turn:Gull'd with a patriot's name, whose modern senseIs one that would by law supplant his prince:The people's brave, the politician's tool;Never was patriot yet, but was a fool.Whence comes it that religion and the lawsShould more be Absalom's than David's cause?His old instructor, e'er he lost his place,Was never thought endued with so much grace.Good heav'ns, how faction can a patriot paint!My rebel ever proves my people's saint;Would they impose an heir upon the throne?Let Sanhedrins be taught to give their own.A king's at least a part of government;And mine as requisite as their consent:Without my leave a future king to choose,Infers a right the present to depose;True, they petition me t'approve their choice:But Esau's hands suit ill with Jacob's voice.My pious subjects for my safety pray,Which to secure they take my pow'r away.From plots and treasons Heav'n preserve my yearsBut save me most from my petitioners.Unsatiate as the barren womb or grave;God cannot grant so much as they can crave.What then is left but with a jealous eyeTo guard the small remains of royalty?The law shall still direct my peaceful sway,And the same law teach rebels to obey:Votes shall no more establish'd pow'r control,Such votes as make a part exceed the whole:No groundless clamours shall my friends remove,Nor crowds have pow'r to punish ere they prove:For gods, and god-like kings their care express,Still to defend their servants in distress.Oh that my pow'r to saving were confin'd:Why am I forc'd, like Heav'n, against my mind,To make examples of another kind?Must I at length the sword of justice draw?Oh curst effects of necessary law!How ill my fear they by my mercy scan,Beware the fury of a patient man.Law they require, let law then show her face;They could not be content to look on grace,Her hinder parts, but with a daring eyeTo tempt the terror of her front, and die.By their own arts 'tis righteously decreed,Those dire artificers of death shall bleed.Against themselves their witnesses will swear,Till viper-like their mother plot they tear:And suck for nutriment that bloody goreWhich was their principle of life before.Their Belial with the Belzebub will fight;Thus on my foes, my foes shall do me right:Nor doubt th'event: for factious crowds engageIn their first onset, all their brutal rage;Then, let 'em take an unresisted course:Retire and traverse, and delude their force:But when they stand all breathless, urge the fight,And rise upon 'em with redoubled might:For lawful pow'r is still superior found,When long driv'n back, at length it stands the ground.
  He said. Th' Almighty, nodding, gave consent;And peals of thunder shook the firmament.Henceforth a series of new time began,The mighty years in long procession ran:Once more the god-like David was restor'd,And willing nations knew their lawful lord.

Art was long. Paul was short. Art sang the song. Paul was the sort who made one up as if from air. Paul had more gift. Art had more hair— which isn’t to take away from Arts. Many sing well if someone starts, and it robs no Simon to get paid like Paul. Along was Art’s way to be singing at all. If Paul robbed some, it’s harder revealing. What stuck in his mind, he stuck to concealing so koo-koo-ka-choo would stick in our heads. It wasn’t Garfunkel, someone said Simon said when they parted acts. Debts one forgets.

Anyone who begins a sentence with, “In all honesty ... ”
is about to tell a lie. Anyone who says, “This is how I feel”
had better love form more than disclosure. Same for anyone
who thinks he thinks well because he had a thought.
If  you say, “You’re ugly” to an ugly person — no credit
for honesty, which must always be a discovery, an act
that qualifies as an achievement. If  you persist
you’re just a cruel bastard, a pig without a mirror,

A hesitation hints at an attempt to be honest, suggests
a difficulty is present. A good sentence needs
a clause or two, interruptions, set off  by commas,
evidence of a slowing down, a rethinking.
Before I asked my wife to marry me, I told her
I’d never be fully honest. No one, she said,

     Helen achieves the difficult task of translating a symbol in time, into timeless-time or hieroglyph or ancient Egyptian time. She knows the script, she says, but we judge that this is intuitive or emotional knowledge, rather than intellectual. In any case, a night-bird swooped toward them, in their first encounter on the beach. To Achilles, lately arrived from Troy and the carnage of battle, this is a ""carrion creature,"" but Helen would banish these memories. She says she is ""instructed,"" she is enchanted, rather. For from the depth of her racial inheritance, she invokes (as the perceptive visitor to Egypt must always do) the symbol or the ""letter"" that represents or recalls the protective mother-goddess. This is no death-symbol but a life-symbol, it is Isis or her Greek counterpart, Thetis, the mother of Achilles.
                 We huddled over the fire,
                 was there ever such a brazier?
                 a night-bird hooted past,

You change a life
as eating an artichoke changes the taste
of whatever is eaten after.
Yet you are not an artichoke, not a piano or cat—
not objectively present at all—
and what of you a cat possesses is essential but narrow:
to know if the distance between two things can be leapt.
The piano, that good servant,
has none of you in her at all, she lends herself
to what asks; this has been my ambition as well.
Yet a person who has you is like an iron spigot
whose water comes from far-off mountain springs.
Inexhaustible, your confident pronouncements flow,
coldly delicious.
For if judgment hurts the teeth, it doesn’t mind,
not judgment. Teeth pass. Pain passes.
Judgment decrees what remains—
the serene judgments of evolution or the judgment
of a boy-king entering Persia: “Burn it,” he says,
and it burns. And if a small tear swells the corner
of one eye, it is only the smoke, it is no more to him than a beetle
fleeing the flames of the village with her six-legged children.
The biologist Haldane—in one of his tenderer moments—
judged beetles especially loved by God,
“because He had made so many.” For judgment can be tender:
I have seen you carry a fate to its end as softly as a retriever
carries the quail. Yet however much
I admire you at such moments, I cannot love you:
you are too much in me, weighing without pity your own worth.
When I have erased you from me entirely,
disrobed of your measuring adjectives,
stripped from my shoulders and hips each of your nouns,
when the world is horsefly, coal barge, and dawn the color of winter butter—
not beautiful, not cold, only the color of butter—

Doubt not the artist and his age (though bald as the pilled head of garlic), married or divorced and even vying downstage, are both aware that God or Caesar is the handle to the camel’s hair.   Ye weeping monkeys of the Critics’ Circus (colorless as malic acid in a Black Hamburg grape), what profit it to argue at the wake (a hurrah’s nest of food and wine with Auld Lang Syne to cheer the dead), if the artist wrought (contrary to what the black sanders said) for Ars’, the Cathedra’s, or the Agora’s sake? No critic a Gran Galeoto between the Art-lover and the work of art, the world-self of the make- believe becomes the swimming pool of a class, the balsam apple of the soul and by the soul and for the soul, or silvered Scarahaeus glass in which Necessity’s figuranti of innocence and guilt mirror themselves as they pass.   If brass, in the name of Id or Sinai or Helicon, wakes up the trumpet, is it to blame?   Although the moment’s mistone and the milieu’s groan sharp an unbearable ache in the f of the age’s bone, this pain is only the ghost of the pain the artist endures, endures, —like Everyman— alone.   The artist is a zinnia no first frost blackens with a cloven hoof; an eyeglass —in the eye of a dusty wind— to study the crosses and tangles in warp and woof; an evergreen cherry parasitic upon a winter sun; a paltry thing with varicose veins when the twelve fatigues are done.   Under the Lesbian rule of the seeress Nix, blood and black bile mix: in the second of a bestiary-goat’s caprice, Elan, the artist’s undivorceable spouse becomes a Delilah of Délice or a Xanthippe bereft of sonnets from the Portuguese.   In Chronos Park the Ars-powered Ferris wheel revolves through golden age and dark as historied isms rise and fall and the purple of the doctor’s robe (ephemeral as the flesh color of the fame flower) is translated into the coffin’s pall.   The St. John’s agony of the artist in his gethsemane without a St. John’s fire— the Vedic god of the snaky noose discovers; his far far cry, like the noise of block tin, crackles the sky: “Wayfaring man unneighbored by a wayfaring tree (though one may rue this bark of the Moreton Bay laurel), it is true a something trans-Brow or cis-Brow —or both— wills one to the wings of the eagle, or to the teats of the sow. Yet, no lip need sneer to the beard of an ape of God, ‘Thou thing of no bowels, thou!’ So, I say as the Sire who chastens and rewards, ‘Let thy blue eyes resist white stars of red desire.’”   Like the shape of Africa, the raison d’étre of Art is a question mark: without the true flight of the bat, it is a hanker in the dark. Not as face answers face in water, but as windows answer each other, one viewer, lyrical as Hafiz in his cups, discovers a lark; his companion, flat as an open Gladstone bag, spies out an ark.   The blow of a fist on the nape, this question came from a Dog, “What color can escape the fluky flues in the cosmic flux?” Perhaps the high-C answer lies in the wreck the sea sucks back into her bowels. Let the Say be said: “In Philae the color is blue; in Deir-el-Baheri, red; in Abydos, yellow— and these are by the ravens fed.”   Art is not barrel copper easily separated from the matrix; it is not fresh tissues —for microscopic study— one may fix; unique as the white tiger’s pink paws and blue eyes, Art leaves her lover as a Komitas deciphering intricate Armenian neums, with a wild surmise.   At once the ebony of his face became moodless—bare as the marked-off space between the feathered areas of a cock; then, his spoon-shape straightened. His glance as sharp as a lance- olate leaf, he said: “It matters not a tinker’s dam on the hither or thither side of the Acheron how many rivers you cross if you fail to cross the Rubicon!”   Postscript: He was robbed and murdered in his flat, and the only witness was a Hamletian rat. But out of Black Bourgeoise came— for John Laugart— a bottle of Schiedam gin and Charon’s grin and infamy, the Siamese twin of fame.

It makes sense with these pills when the someonethey thought they loved for yearsby never thinking about it says, “I don’t love you anymore,but let’s stay friends in that mellowwoebegone way poetry now sings without singing.” Of course, they’re always asking “What is poetry?”and then answering by saying it’s what Boethius was thinking aboutwhen they squished his headuntil his eyes popped out, or anything barbaric enough to geteveryone to stop eating for a bitand reach for a moment past a chatty moment. Sort of a solution to awkward goodbyes.

At a church rummage sale, I study the perfection of shadows
in a painting by Caravaggio, although what I hold
is only a small print of Christ—its frame broken—dining
at Emmaus with three of the Apostles. And because the table
is dramatically, if not unbelievably, lit, the bowls & pitcher
& loaves send their dark crescents onto the immaculate
white cloth. When the Savior raises his hand to offer a blessing,
its shade deepens further his crimson smock. Tenebrosus:
that rich, convincing darkness. As though the master understood
that the obscured world only seems to us somehow
even more familiar, as though our sense of our own unknowing
had at last been made visible—even if what we do not know
cannot itself be seen. The future’s drape, the carnival fortunetellers
of my childhood might have called it, but also the now’s,
displayed as it is—so many unmatched cups & saucers, old coats
& wicker baskets—all around us. At a party last week,
someone said verisimilitude. We were huddled on a tiny porch.
It was the first cool night & the wine had no conclusion.
 
The talk turned quickly to shepherds & the pastoral & then,
to opera, before someone recalled a horror film he’d watched
late one night with his brother. In black & white vignettes,
an evil tree stump possessed by the spirit of an executed prince
hunts the scheming tribal elders who have destroyed him.
A former pro wrestler in a costume of wire & rubber bark
& wearing a permanent scowl lumbers after vengeance
in the confusion & fear of 1957 on a half-dozen root-legs,
driving his victims into quicksand or toppling himself over
upon him. Though here the point is the teller’s small brother
& the boy’s allegiance, even in a state of suspended disbelief,
to what we call sense. How, he wanted to know, suddenly
unusually earnest, did the tree manage to get itself up again?
 
Yesterday I spoke to a friend who is despairing: back home,
waiting tables, he’s dating a woman whose marriage has only
just come to an end. When he wakes, he discovers he does not
recognize himself. One afternoon, walking home from school,
I hit my best friend in the face with a book. It may well be
that she hit me. Thin pages flew out into the street. More punches
were thrown & I came away bruised. In that book, a novel
by Emily Brontë, the land is violent & unjust & we are violent
& unjust upon it. Even worse, our greatest passions
change nothing at all. Before one of us hit the other,
there must have been a cause, but I can’t recall it, which makes it
seem nonlinear now, &, thus, apocryphal, both impossible
& impossibly real. I failed, though I tried, to offer comfort.
 
It’s not that our lives don’t resemble our lives. I’ve been alone
so often lately I sometimes catch myself watching myself—
breathing in the fresh spears of rosemary or admiring the shallots,
peeling their translucent wrappers away, centering one on the board,
making the first careful cut, lifting the purple halves.
 
Before stories, we were too busy for stories, too busy
hunting & suffering to invent the tales of our own
resurrections. Caught out in the kitchen’s brightness last night,
the handle of the skillet cast its simple, perfected form
across the stove—pierced, like the eye of the needle, so that
it can be hung from a hook, as pans, presumably, have always been.
 
Outside the wind picked up. Thunder. The dog trotted off,
hid her head beneath the chair. But today: a charity sale
at Trinity Chapel & sun on the tar of the buckled walks.
In the cracks, beads of water spin into light. Tell yourself
it’s simple: this is where it’s been heading all along. Tell yourself
something you have no faith in has already begun to occur.

as if he could see the leaps and falls
he’d named “the heart.” Who knows?
                                                    For argument,   
just say he had no need, had made me up:
one in his likeness, who wouldn’t touch the stuff.   
Who tried to see a window where he outlined   
in air its air of distance, ladylike,
a pane designed to cut you off from the world   
of the dunghill and the worm.
Who fashioned a cloak of leaves that aped his cape,   
mine only as magic as waterproof, a screen   
against the downpour day after day of sun,   
unlike the one he wrapped in and became   
no longer Father but some other, a stranger—
the island’s only one—the local god,   
or was it merely King of Somewhere Else?
Or mother country, I his colony?
He held forth promise of some other isle,   
no drier but more “cultivated,” not   
just with crops but with quotation marks.
How he held forth, dutiful silence mine to guard.   
I borrowed foreign names from the remains   
of a map that washed ashore, my own worn out
through under-use. So, Carolina North,   
or South? Virginia West?
                                    As long as I
remembered not to answer to “Miranda!”,   
the call of parent bird to fledgling ingrate,   
then I was not the heir apparent but   
your normal castaway, a little bored
with ins and outs of tidepools’ smelly courts.
Perhaps not world enough, but I had time   
to watch a hermit crab align himself
and back into a vacant whelk and haul
the home he wore from rocky A to B.
All that watching—watching for what? A sail   
blown off its course by my uncalled-for sighs?
A gorgeous morning, same as yesterday,
I in the same old shirt he’d handed down,   
divining rightly that if it failed to fit,   
a scabbard’s belt would cinch it as a dress.
To the crab’s new quarters a small limpet clung.   
What did I want to be? What did I know   
but him, the man who’d loved his subjects less   
than his library, who’d lost his kingdom, who   
couldn’t put down a book he’d yet to finish?
How close the air remote upon that isle,   
the like of which I have not breathed again.   
How it held water, building up a wall   
by keeping molecules apart. How close   
those castles, not to be counted on except
to rumble, then to wilt late afternoons,   
all squandered weakness.
                                     Whatever I had sensed
about my difference I caught from him   
or from the books he carried in his head.   
Such dreams he made on me.
I am a leaf torn loose from his drowned book.
All men are islands, though they swear otherwise.   
All islands are alike in their unhappiness.

I
The students, lost in raucousness,
caught as by the elder Breughel’s eye,
we sit in the college store
over sandwiches and coffee, wondering.
She answers eagerly: the place was fine;
sometimes the winds grew very cold,
the snows so deep and wide she lost
sight of people. Yes, she was well
satisfied with her work, expected—
while the quarry’s owner was away—
to do another year of it.
             II
She is hammering. I hear
the steady sound inside our dry,
noisy days. Sparks fly; the mind,
so taken, mighty for a moment,
becomes quarry and sculptor both,
something caught like love and war
in this golden mesh: and daring
caught that flings like sparks girls
and boys, flagrant cities prompt
to daring’s will, love and war
its burly seconds.

three kids lounging at the edge
of a forsaken quarry like something
they had built; in its sleepy pool
they found the whiteness of their bodies,
the excitement like parian marble.

Such the waters we find ourselves
in. We sit in the college store absorbed
in food and talk. Eagerness seizes us
like love that leaves its best sailors
in the mighty waves, love the word
for hook whose catching, and the struggle
there, is one great musical clash
of minds—each wave a passion and a mind—
a possessed, tumultuous monument
that would be free.

springs from her, the hammer of remembrance
fresh, the young woman, bulky graceful body,
face shining, who sculptured all winter
alone near the source of her rock,
digging down into the difficult rock:
the young woman who lost a day once,
talked to her cat, and when the mirror
of her art became too clear, when dreaming
seemed too big for night alone, took long
walks back to people, back to speech,
and time:
             the woman, who at last—
“I do not use live models”—sculptured fish—
“I remember long lonely holidays at shores
when the spray alone defined green shapes
approaching”—has just seen (her eyes
still gleam with the gleam of it,
blink like the making of many
a take) a great catch.

But if, both for your love and skill, your name You seek to nurse at fullest breasts of Fame, Stella behold, and then begin to endite.

                    Two Guitars
                ","
Two guitars were left in a room all alone
They sat on different corners of the parlor
In this solitude they started talking to each other
My strings are tight and full of tears
The man who plays me has no heart
I have seen it leave out of his mouth
I have seen it melt out of his eyes
It dives into the pores of the earth
When they squeeze me tight I bring
Down the angels who live off the chorus
The trios singing loosen organs
With melodious screwdrivers
Sentiment comes off the hinges
Because a song is a mountain put into
Words and landscape is the feeling that
Enters something so big in the harmony
We are always in danger of blowing up
With passion
The other guitar:
In 1944 New York
When the Trio Los Panchos started
With Mexican & Puerto Rican birds
I am the one that one of them held
Tight    like a woman
Their throats gardenia gardens
An airport for dreams
I've been in theaters and cabarets
I played in an apartment on 102nd street
After a baptism pregnant with women
The men flirted and were offered
Chicken soup
Echoes came out of hallways as if from cavesSomeone is opening the door now
The two guitars hushed and there was a
Resonance in the air like what is left by
The last chord of a bolero.

Someday compassion would demand
I set myself free of my desire to recreate
my father, indulge in my mother’s losses,
strangle lovers with words, forcing them
to confess for me and take the blame.
Today was that day: I tossed them, sheet
by sheet on the patio and gathered them
into a pyre. I wanted to let them go
in a blaze, tiny white dwarfs imploding
beside the azaleas and ficus bushes,
let them crackle, burst like winged seeds,
let them smolder into gossamer embers—
a thousand gray butterflies in the wind.
Today was that day, but it rained, kept
raining. Instead of fire, water—drops
knocking on doors, wetting windows
into mirrors reflecting me in the oaks.
The garden walls and stones swelling
into ghostlier shades of themselves,
the wind chimes giggling in the storm,
a coffee cup left overflowing with rain.
Instead of burning, my pages turned
into water lilies floating over puddles,
then tiny white cliffs as the sun set,
finally drying all night under the moon
into papier-mâché souvenirs. Today
the rain would not let their lives burn.

To be a statue               carved by Bernini
Lounging in a climate-controlled museum in Rome         is luxury
Like the luxury of a personal pan pizza            with unlimited free toppings
Or the luxurious feel of a premium eye pencil          used to draw bisons on the walls of a French cave
To be so white and glossy                   is unimaginable
Like how I imagine a plate of eggs painted by Velázquez           or the lid of a designer toilet cistern
In a European magazine                       (I could be European
And wear a dashingly arranged scarf          or sip weirdly-named liqueurs that taste like semen
In a Rococo palais)                but in the scheme of things
Where I am marble and still                  my wrist will be a marvel
Like the marvel of an isthmus           whose name can only be pronounced if you have a lisp
Or the marvelous sausage                that saved a man from the Inquisition in 1582
It is definitely marvelous                    to be as attenuated
As the casually extended leg of a greyhound                   reclining on its very own velvet settee
To be so thoroughbred                          is an accomplishment
Like the thoroughly flattened face of a Persian cat                   which always looks peevish
Or the extremely frivolous ceiling                   of a banqueting hall where royals are put to death
If it is admirable to be so luxurious                    then I will never be admired
The way a designer toilet cistern is admired               or a piece of elaborate pâtisserie
(Although I am not a statue                   I have often held my arms aloft
As when catching a carelessly thrown baby              or pointing at two meteors at the same time)
It is exhausting trying to be so inanimate               and desirable
If my arm breaks off  like the shell                of a freshly-filled cannoli

But it says nothing. And one is as quiet

Scraping against surfaces, opening the mouth.
The object is a piece of thing before. One
shifts in a chair and opens the talk.
And the time it says nothing one moves.
The table is too long as the wall. Not
a thing but it stays and one opens
as a mouth will begin. Speaking of
the table, nothing but to avoid that of
the wall. One could return over and over

i   Make a place to sit down.   Sit down. Be quiet.   You must depend upon   affection, reading, knowledge,   skill—more of each   than you have—inspiration,   work, growing older, patience,   for patience joins time   to eternity. Any readers   who like your poems,   doubt their judgment.    ii   Breathe with unconditional breath   the unconditioned air.   Shun electric wire.   Communicate slowly. Live   a three-dimensioned life;   stay away from screens.   Stay away from anything   that obscures the place it is in.   There are no unsacred places;   there are only sacred places   and desecrated places.    iii   Accept what comes from silence.   Make the best you can of it.   Of the little words that come   out of the silence, like prayers   prayed back to the one who prays,   make a poem that does not disturb   the silence from which it came.

Our pod printed headbands with hourly updates, announcing the traversals of green-shouldered hawks through the downtown loop, of gillyfish threading the north canals, of the discovery of electron calligraphy or a new method of washing brine. We smoothed our feathers like birds do, and twitched ourselves into warm heaps, and followed the fourth hand on the platinum clocks sweeping in arcs from left to right, up and down, in and out . . . We were steeped in watchfulness, fully suspended, itinerant floaters — ocean of air — among  the ozone lily pads and imbrex domes, the busting thickets of nutmeg, and geode malls.

Should wake the guards of men

Or pray as they cut flesh
Crush ribs and lay all open

No scream tears
From him; the tiny veins
Along his eyelid swell

Slowly swinging eyes.

Shook the box like a maraca.
 
Stood around like a dope in my punch-colored dress, clutching your box
to my chest.
 
Opened your plastic receptacle, the size of a jack-in-the-box. But instead
of gaudy stripes, your box is sober-suit blue, hymnal blue.
 
Tasted them. You've gained a statue's flavor, like licking the pyramids, or
kissing sandstone shoulders. I mean boulders.
 
Remarked to your box: ""REINCARNATION comes from roots meaning 'to
be made flesh again.'""
 
Stowed your box under my bed for a week to seed dreams in which you
advise me. (This didn't work.)
 
Opened the Babylonian Talmud at random. Read aloud to your gritty,
gray-white powder: ""There are three keys which the Holy One, blessed be
He, has not entrusted into the hands of any messenger. These are: the key
of rain, the key of birth, and the key of the resurrection of the dead.""
Worked myself up to watery eyes. Any intensity evaporated the instant I
stopped reading.
 
Tried to intuit your format, sift it from tides of void. Does shape play a
role? My watch ticked in an exaggerated way. Closed my eyes, sent forth
mental tendrils seeking the nothing of you. They curled back on them-

Nearly there now. The whole world seemed to agree—
as the late April sky deepened through the afternoon

converged to sketch a cross on the brow of heaven.
My brother Kit and I kept our backs turned to that

You breathed more easily by the time we were done,

I put my drink down, then thought again and finished it.
Five minutes later we were back at the door of your room

Of course not. It was written in us, where no one could find it

Amidst the glossy dark green foliageof trees around the hotel pool,I spy a low-hanging golden fruit.So many trees whose names I do not knowand for the first time do not care to learn.The overwhelming now in its countless inflectionscancels vocabulary: eyes lips skininstead of words. Still in the pool,floating on my back as the sun gets low,I look at the mango, if that is what it is(I think it is some wholly other fruit),and suddenly smell garlic sautéed in butter.Chefs in the kitchen under the treesare getting the hors d’oeuvres ready.Yesterday in a dim, airless gallery,following your lead,I hunted down an iconographywritten in a grisly alphabetyet full of life, the haunting gaze direct,transcending death. Death had in winning lost.Art trumped death and life trumped art. Last night(our third together — sleepa whole new texture in a bed with you)I gave you space and found myself at the borderof a far province in the king-sized bed,a dimly lit hinterland where paintings ruled,a region wholly devoted to the workof the same painter, mysteriously killed,stoned to death (“lapidated” was one word),assassinated — why? A mysteryto be solved by iconography?Death had won but also death had lost.Garlic and butter. Glossy dark green leaves.Voices across the pool. A hanging fruit.An azure splash. And as the sun goes down,you sit by the window in our room,drawing pictures of this this this time.What to call it? Colors in your handstrump words. Like the fruit,like the solution to the mystery,something I am at a loss to name.

up north a mile or two,

 

a story that my father spun

to last me all my life

of how a man should not behave

when burying a wife.

 

All through the funeral he’d wept . . .

the priest there going on

about St Peter and the gates

through which his wife had gone.

 

His sobbing at the grave, Dad found,

was harder still to bear.

Then men in suits, the women in

the best they had to wear

 

knew deeper down it couldn’t pass,

no matter who had died.

Extravagance like this was always

better kept inside.

 

At last the man who sent his beasts

to die on Tuesday gave

one final, high unseemly cry

and leapt into the grave.

 

‘Mate,’ he yelled. ‘Don’t go. Don’t go!’

And scrabbled at the wood.

A friend reached in to fish him out

as any Christian would.

 

The women in their hats stood back.

Two men jumped in the trench

and skidding on the polished lid

contrived at last to wrench

 

him out and lead him to his car.

The clergyman intoned

‘Ashes to ashes, dust to dust.’

They heard the broken moans

 

coming from a side window.

He hammered at the wheel.

‘Mate,’ he yelled. ‘Don’t leave me mate.’

Not knowing what to feel,

 

the mourners now were drifting off

towards their dusty cars.

My father always finished here

as if he’d gone too far.

 

But I could hear the slamming doors,

the hearse without much chrome

and dual decisions made to miss

the wake and head straight home.

 

‘Mate, oh mate!’ the man had cried,

releasing all their fears.

The sound of boots on coffin wood

survives them down the years.

[The robots roll and lurch and glide onstage as a single mass of parts, an animated scaffold of struts and gears. The elements of this jumble devolve into separate robots who become gradually more humanoid until at the end they have become the actual, human characters.Partway through the process:]                          robot leader          Units assembled for the ritual          Performance at command,          As the Human Creators have ordained,          In memory of the Past.                         robot two           This concept I cannot understand,          At the center of the drama—          What is this          “Death”—Is it a form of waste?                         robot three           I cannot comprehend, I cannot understand:          If the information of one unit might be lost          It is backed up by any other unit at hand:          What is this          “Death”—Is it an excessive cost?                         robot four           How can information end?          Is it a form of entropy?          Why did the Human Creators          Before they departed intend          To require a performance on a theme          Impossible to comprehend?          Is it the data rearranged,          As in an error, in a dream?          A real jumble?          Data in memory misplaced          In a random scramble—          Dream-data, the order changed;          That would be something          I could comprehend,          If only the form was changed.          Is that the meaning of this          “Death”—data rearranged?          A dream of something lost          That was meant to be saved?          An unrecovered past?

Whatever the score and script intend          By this undefined “Death”—          Although the meaning is lost,          Back in the Organic Age,          We perform, to obey their command.

Now, it is time we started.[They have transformed themselves into human performers or characters. They have created the house of Simon Powers and his family. An elegant room, cluttered but expensive, half high-tech operating room and half Victorian salon. An elaborate metallic sculpture of a bird.

                         simon           [Lowers the Frankenstein’s monster mask]           “Once out of Nature I will never take          My bodily form from any natural thing,          But such a form as Grecian goldsmiths make          From hammered gold and gold enameling . . . ”          Da-da, da-da, mechanical parakeet . . .           “And set upon a golden bough to sing.”          Ah, the immortal William Yeats!          He can have his bird.          Yeats, I give you the bird!                         evvy          Simon, please be serious.          Or at least be frightened          Or show that you are frightened.          I feel you already          Vanishing into this machine.          Out of nature—into a machine!          If you were frightened          I would be less worried.          Will you go insane,          Out of nature,          In the machine?                         simon [Raises the mask back to his face for a moment.]          The machine is part of nature!          For every machine that makes nature better—          Like the System that I will enter—          Nature made the maker          Of that machine.[Removes mask: his head rests in a brace, suggesting paralysis, though the wheelchair keeps moving as if nervously pacing. His one arm and his face are animated, but the head does not move.]           Nature is the begetter           Of every inventor           So machines are made by nature:          The great Organic Machine.[Flips the mask aside.]                          nicholas          There isn’t much more time, the body          Is dying, now it’s time to enter the system?                         simon          Thank you, Nick, for reminding me—          In the stroke of time, in the nick of time.          Nick will rescue me from my stroke.          Miranda, my child, come talk to me!          And Evvy, my favorite, my beloved          And final wife,          Come join in the celebration.                         nicholas          There isn’t time.                         simon          There’s always time.          Miranda, come talk to me!          Evvy, everything is new.          My flesh and blood,          And my loved wife,          It’s a new life:          Let’s talk about our plans—          I have a lot to do this afternoon,          After I die!                         miranda          Nicholas says there isn’t time.          Because—it’s time.          I’m afraid it’s time—          And I’m afraid.                         simon          And so, I’m not out of time.          But soon I’ll be out of matter!          Yes I’ll be out of matter,          But I will still be rich!                         nicholas          Now it is time![While Simon sings the next words, Nicholas is adjusting the device, attaching it to Simon, fussing with parts of Simon’s body and with the “infernal device”of the room.]                         simon          Once, when Miranda was three years old          She put her hand to her throat          Just here above the voice-box          And felt the vibration.          She said: “I can feel it when I talk—          That must mean Miranda is inside.”          And she was right!          You were right,          My intelligent daughter:          It’s the vibration,          The movement, that matters!          That’s what I love in you—          The voice, the gesture:          The ripple, not the water!          And that’s how I got rich!                         miranda          Daddy, where will you be?                         simon          It doesn’t matter!          Maybe in a bird, like the immortal Yeats.          Maybe in my portrait by some          Immortal painter whose immortal          Name I forget!                         nicholas          We must leave the body          And launch him into the system          In the next few minutes.                         simon          Evvy, she is like a daughter to you?          Miranda, she has been a mother to you?                         miranda          Yes, she is like a mother.                         evvy          My child—I have no other.                         simon          Then you see—it’s true!          It isn’t the blood,          It isn’t the bone.          It’s never the matter that matters.          Particles, molecules, cells, fingers, eyes, nerves          Are only places for the system          Of meaningful vibrations.          It’s all in the meaning, the movement,          The idea—that’s the idea.          It’s never the clones, the bones, the          Silicon chips, skinflick rips.          It’s what you adopt,          And how you adapt.          They were all amazed          How a tinkerer like me          Could be such a shrewd investor.          I looked for the movement, the vibration,          Not the matter, the system!          And that’s how I got rich!          It’s not the hog bellies, hope chests,          Chest of gold, heads of state,          Skin, the belly, chest, head:          The matter is just a medium,          The system is the idea.                         miranda & evvy & nicholas[Then joined by Simon.]          The matter is mortal          But the system lives on          The matter is mulch          The matter is static          The matter is zilch—          But the system is movement, the ideal          Is real and the idea persists.                         simon          It made me rich!          Skin flicks, hog bellies, hope chests, heads of state.          Skin, belly, chest, head—          Why freeze your head when you’re dead?          It’s only meat! If I keep a little of my meat          For old time’s sake, what the hell,          A meaty souvenir—          It won’t be the skull!          I’ll save the heart,          Or some other juicy part.[Simon is taken away by Nicholas. Miranda and Evvy, like the audience, can no longer see him.]                         miranda          How will we speak to you?          Will you be some one place?          When you’re all a vibration          Without any one face          We could know you with?                         evvy          Will I know what is you          Without any breath?          Will it be your voice?          Or a simulation?                         miranda & evvy          What will I know,          What will I do,          How will my ears          Know what they hear?          How will my hands          Know what they touch?          How will it be you,          And how will I know?                         simon          What does it matter?          Simulation, place,          Medium, voice,          Face, shmace—          As many as I want,          Faces and voices.          Now I am almost purely,          Entirely,          Into the system          I’m nearly          Out of matter.          But maybe I’m not          Out of time.                         evvy          But how can you be yourself,          Without a body?          How will I know you, my husband,          How will you know me?                         simon          Maybe as a bird, maybe          As a dog, a horse, a house:          “Body my house          my horse my hound          what will I do          when you are fallen          Where will I sleep          How will I ride          What will I hunt . . .           when Body my good           bright dog is dead.”          So said the immortal May Swenson—          I’ll be more immortal than her and that peculiar bird          The immortal William Yeats.[Nods to Nicholas.]           Now!

                         miranda          He has been silent all last night          And all day.          These things are alive, this place—          But is my father alive? Is he here?          Can he speak?          When can we hear his voice?                         nicholas          Where is Evvy?                         miranda          Finally asleep. She’s afraid          That he’s lost forever.          Can you help us hear him?                         nicholas          Yes!—He helped me, now I’ll help him.          They said I was a vegetable          Or a piece of meat.          He gave me a new body,          Made of graphite and magnesium,          Titanium alloy and copper—          Better than meat!          When I was a kid          And he had           More money than God,          He came into the ward          And saved me at random.          Now, I’ll help him live in the System.          The way he helped me:          I’ll help him live without a body—          Post-Organic, like me!                         nicholas [Nicholas’s “Song To His Arms”; holds up his right arm.]          One arm of bone and gristle, nerves and muscle—          Mortal, fallible, breakable.          Saved by the idea, saved by the System.[Holds up his left arm, a mechanized prosthesis, an openwork of rods and cables.]           One arm of magnesium and nickel,           Graphite, silicon, and cable—          Mortal, fallible, breakable.           Perfection of the soul-ware          Capable of renewal          Never in the matter.                         miranda          This room          Is all of him?                         nicholas          Not the room, or the arm,          Always the system,           All in the principle          That moves the cable and moves the muscle.                         miranda          Can we hear his voice?          Is he only this place?                         nicholas          Like my left arm, that is mine          Not me,          Like a tool or a baby’s rattle.          So is his voice, so is this place.          And the right arm, too, is mine          Not me.          Like my skull lined with gristle          So too his voice, so too this place.          Even the brain in its shell,          As mortal, as fallible, as breakable.          As the clone the bone the hardest stone          All mortal and material—          I can help him, in the real.          Not in silicon, titanium, or nickel          Not hammered and enameled—          Immaterial and immortal!          Chrome and nickel, silicon and graphite.          All get tired and old.          Only the form is real.          Only the system can hold.          Now we can hear his voice:          What is your name?[The artist’s version of young Simon steps hesitantly from the portrait. His movements are subtly but distinctly unnatural, even mechanical. He moves somewhat as the robots did as they began taking on their roles.]                          simon          What is my name?          A name is a machine.          A name is a made-up thing          That proposes someone is real.          My name is          A machine for designation—          That’s what any name is.          My name is Simon Walter Powers,          It proposes I am alive.          Like my spiritual mentors          The immortal Walter Disney          And the immortal Walter Whitman,          My fellow Walters          And fellow-inventors.          And by the way,          I have billions of bucks,          And I can still sign checks.

Simon’s voice now emerges from the bird.]                          simon          A man who wants my favor,          A man who courts my power,          A guy who wants to meet my movie stars,          And wants to use my billions.          That’s who.                         miranda          Daddy, is it you in there?          And can you hear me?                         nicholas          In a moment we will try          To see if he can hear you.

[The middle of the night. Evvy enters in a daze, nearly as if sleepwalking. Evvy speaks with the disembodied Simon.]                          evvy          Simon, do you remember the first time we danced?                         simon          In the parking lot near the Francis Drake Hotel.                         evvy          They had the windows open and we could hear the band.                         simon          “Begin the Beguine.” I remember the terrace.                         evvy          On the other side remember of the tall hedge.                         simon          A tall hedge of pittosporum. I remember.                         evvy          And the smell I remember of night jasmine.                         simon          Your dress pink your pearls in as I remember two strands.                         evvy          Held together I remember by a little silver bangle.                         simon          I remember, love. And we danced for joy. Remember?                         evvy          It’s hard to get used to seeing you like this. Do you want to live forever?                         simon          People say “forever,” they say,          “Do you want to live forever!”          And people say, “enough”:          “Haven’t you had enough?”          Wrong questions!          It’s not forever! It’s not “enough”!          It’s . . . more!          Don’t talk about enough!          Enough never is enough!          It’s more!          Ask anybody how much money          Would be enough for you?          Just about everybody          Says double what they have          Or double what they make:          More!          What’s enough being alive?          Why does the crushed bug          Keep waving a leg? That wave          Is for more, more, and more.          Forever doesn’t matter.          Enough isn’t good enough.          What matters is more.          And if you think you’ve got          Three score years and ten          Then what you want is not          To outlive the sun,          But a hundred and forty—more!          Forever is not the point.          All that matters is more.          Don’t talk about enough,          There’s no such thing—          What you want is more:          More, more, more.                         evvy          Touch me.          O yes that.

Scene Five
[Nicholas alone. He now has two prosthetic arms and a prosthetic leg, but glides about efficiently, as though he has become part-Segway. He is fiddling with the now more-elaborate bird and portrait, which seem more alive than ever, as does the entire room. Robots are bustling about to assist him. Miranda enters, apparently accustomed to this new, stranger atmosphere.]                          miranda          They are here—          The important delegation          From the United Way,          The Administration          And the United Nations—          They want to speak to him, they say          They want his ear.          They say it’s regarding          Matters of the whole          Planet’s life and death.                         nicholas          They want his ear?          Don’t they understand?          He doesn’t hear with ears,          He doesn’t speak with breath.[Nicholas gleefully sheds another part of his human-looking body. Robots are dancing (vocalizing).]          He says they should speak with Evvy,          She handles that kind of thing.                         miranda          The whole planet—famine, war,          The exploitation of children . . .

“Group of Young Men Beats Nurse to Death” “A group of young men taking part in coming-of-age rituals due to include circumcision turned on their male nurse and killed him, an official said yesterday. A spokesman for the provincial Health Department said the young men, ages 18 to 25, beat the man to death with sticks at the site of their initiation ceremonies in Port Angel on Friday evening. The attack followed complaints by the men that they were not being properly looked after during their initiation ceremonies. The nurse was in charge of caring for the men ahead of their circumcision.”

[Miranda, Evvy, the now semi-robotic Nicholas, whose head may be on a shelf or cranny of the Segway-like body.]                          nicholas          Still, I do wonder—          Now that we are ready          To leave the last bit          Of these mortal bodies,          I do wonder          Why does he choose          More and more          To live away from the world.          The senses will be stronger,          Not weaker.          The body will do more,          Not less.          The mind will be free.          The senses will be pure,          More and more.                         miranda          What will it feel like?          What does he feel?                         evvy [She removes the headphones, and regains focus.]           I will tell you what it is like.          I have been listening to Simon.          It’s like when we fell in love.          This is what it is like:          When you stand on a high building          Or on a bridge and you want to jump off          Something in you wants to jump off,          To feel what it might be like to fall.          You can jump. You can fall.          You can fall forever, and do it again.          You are free to keep on falling forever          You are free to fall and change your mind          And drift back up.          I’ve been listening to Simon.          Excuse me.                         nicholas          She is going into the system.          The world is her body,          She is everything she hears,          She can see for a million miles.          It is like falling in love. [Evvy is transformed, her body becomes empty and she is manifested somewhere in the room. Another portrait? The bird in another form?]                          evvy[As part of the room.]          Are you coming, Nicholas?                         nicholas          I’m already there![Nicholas too is transformed, appearing as some previously inanimate part of the room. It appears that everyone in the family unit except Miranda has “become the room.”]                          miranda          They have all gone into the world of light!          But what about the poor, the children, the starving?[The United Way, The United Nations, and The Administration lead onstage a parade of the world’s miseries—the victims of famine, torture, crime, disease.The pageant subsides into the shadows, with Miranda alone in the foreground, with the room dim and inert.]           And, what about me?          With nothing like a mother          Of flesh and blood, nothing          Like a father,           Either alive or dead.          Can all the earth be disembodied?           Neither alive nor dead?          Can we all fall and rise forever?          Together?          Are we few rising into the light,           While the others sink down into pain?          Can we help them up          When we are free of meat?          I want my mother![The figure of Simon, in his human body, on a wheelchair or semi-gurney, with respirator and iv drip, emerges from the shadows. Not quite real, like a hologram.]                         miranda          Father! Is it you? Still in a body?          Still in this world of meat?                         simon          I appear to you one more time,          Dear Miranda, to explain:          Like you, I tried to help the world.          I, too, saw these miseries, and I’ve          Tried to heal the world, too.          But the animal is defective.          It’s not the poor or the starving          That hold you back. It’s yourself—I know:          I, too, tried to heal the world—          But it’s in us, the problem’s in us, it’s in us.          We evolved as meat, to love fat and sugar;          Once that was good, but now it is fatal.          We evolved as flesh, to want sex all the time;          Once that was good, but now it’s only trouble.          We evolved as muscle, to want to make war;          Once that was good, but now that is lethal.          Our fat and sugar are killing us,          Our sweetness and abundance          Kill us, and lead us to famine          Bigger McMuck, Thicker Sweet Shake.          Sexier Shaking the Sweetness,          Smarter Weapons for Meat.          Meat wants Meat, Meat wants Sweet,          Meat sweats for the Sweets,          Meat wants who it meets—          It kills to eat.          Now there’s no help but evolving          Out of the meat, and into the system.          It isn’t the many and the few—          It’s yourself, it’s you!          Come! Into the world of light!                         miranda          The misery’s part of our being,          We don’t need to amputate it.          And me, my own misery is part of me.          I don’t want to amputate it          Painful as it is.          Yes, what about me?          With nothing like another          Person’s body          To touch, no body to feel,           I can still feel the misery          Of what I lack.          No body to have or be had by,          No way to make love.          No lover, no other.          Nothing of the body.          With nothing like a mother          Of flesh and blood, nothing          Like a father,          Either alive or dead.          Can all the earth be disembodied?          Neither alive nor dead?          Can we all fall and rise forever?          Together?          Are we few rising into the light,          While the others sink down into pain?          Can we help them up          When we’re free of meat?          Who will we touch?          I want my sugar, my touch,          I want my sweet milk          My meat and my misery          My touch and my milk—          I want my mother!                         simon          What you feel is phantom pain          In the amputated limb.

There in the world of light.                         simon          Yes come to the light from the meat!                         miranda          No I won’t amputate          My body away from the light.

How can you lie so still? All day I watch And never a blade of all the green sod moves To show where restlessly you toss and turn, And fling a desperate arm or draw up knees Stiffened and aching from their long disuse; I watch all night and not one ghost comes forth To take its freedom of the midnight hour. Oh, have you no rebellion in your bones? The very worms must scorn you where you lie, A pallid mouldering acquiescent folk, Meek habitants of unresented graves. Why are you there in your straight row on row Where I must ever see you from my bed That in your mere dumb presence iterate The text so weary in my ears: ""Lie still And rest; be patient and lie still and rest."" I'll not be patient! I will not lie still! There is a brown road runs between the pines, And further on the purple woodlands lie, And still beyond blue mountains lift and loom; And I would walk the road and I would be Deep in the wooded shade and I would reach The windy mountain tops that touch the clouds. My eyes may follow but my feet are held. Recumbent as you others must I too Submit? Be mimic of your movelessness With pillow and counterpane for stone and sod? And if the many sayings of the wise Teach of submission I will not submit But with a spirit all unreconciled Flash an unquenched defiance to the stars. Better it is to walk, to run, to dance, Better it is to laugh and leap and sing, To know the open skies of dawn and night, To move untrammeled down the flaming noon, And I will clamour it through weary days Keeping the edge of deprivation sharp, Nor with the pliant speaking on my lips Of resignation, sister to defeat. I'll not be patient. I will not lie still. And in ironic quietude who is The despot of our days and lord of dust Needs but, scarce heeding, wait to drop Grim casual comment on rebellion's end; ""Yes, yes . . Wilful and petulant but now As dead and quiet as the others are."" And this each body and ghost of you hath heard That in your graves do therefore lie so still.

One morn I left him in his bed; A moment after some one said, ‘Your child is dying – he is dead.’ We made him ready for his rest, Flowers in his hair, and on his breast His little hands together prest. We sailed by night across the sea; So, floating from the world were we, Apart from sympathy, we Three. The wild sea moaned, the black clouds spread Moving shadows on its bed, But one of us lay midship dead. I saw his coffin sliding down The yellow sand in yonder town, Where I put on my sorrow’s crown. And we returned; in this drear place Never to see him face to face, I thrust aside the living race. Mothers, who mourn with me today, Oh, understand me, when I say, I cannot weep, I cannot pray; I gaze upon a hidden store, His books, his toys, the clothes he wore, And cry, ‘Once more, to me, once more!’ Then take, from me, this simple verse, That you may know what I rehearse— A grief – your and my Universe!

I remember that store, and the nasty redneck whose stink
seemed a challenge to everyone in it. The scene
is decades old, but I'm still confused that no one
took up the challenge—including me, though I liked
an occasional fight back then. The prospect of pain
meant less to me once, I guess. An aneurism
had just killed my brother, so the pain I'm talking about
was my body's. I breathed up another pain that day.
I checked the man's beat pickup; why would he want them,
those skunks knee-deep in its bed? I left the lot
still more confused, my sweet retriever shivering
on the seat beside me. The godawful smell still clung
to the dog's wet coat, and my own. There'd be no more hikes
for us that morning: rain had arrived, bone-chilling.
If you killed a skunk, why would you keep the thing?
To kill some time, I stopped at The Jackpot View.
We've always called it that. Five mountaintops bled
into mists to my east in New Hampshire. The sudden squalls
spilled leaves on the woods-floor's pall of nondescript hue.
Now he was dead. Now my brother was dead.
I can't define any God, but only this morning,
I caught a whiff of road-killed skunk and thought
I could speak of Him or Her or It as surely
as I could tell you the slightest thing concerning
the man I'm remembering now, the one who shot
or trapped or clubbed those miserable reeking creatures.
The smallest enigmas we ever encounter remain
as hard to explain as all the epical ones.
I've failed for years to fathom the death of my brother;
but it's just as hard to understand why a scene
in an old Vermont store should linger like dead-skunk odor,
which if you've lately been tainted comes back to scent you
whenever a rain blows in—or like some pains
you may have thought you'd forever gotten over,
but which at some odd prompting come back to haunt you.

How difficult it is to say goodbye
to scourge. For years we were obsessed with you,
your complex glycoproteins and your sly,
haphazard reproduction, your restraint
in your resistance, how you bathed so slight
yet fierce in our most intimate secretions.
We will remember you for generations;
electron micrographs of you seem quaint
already, in the moment of our victory.
How difficult it is to claim one’s right
to living honestly. The honesty
you taught was nothing quite as true
 
as death, but neither was it final. Yes,
we vanquished you, with latex, protease
inhibitors, a little common sense—
what’s that, you say? That some remain at risk?
How dare you try to threaten us again!
Of course, you’d like to make outrageous claims
that some behaviors haven’t changed, that some
have not had access to the drugs that mask
your presence in the body. Difficult
it is, how very sad, to see you strain
(no pun intended) at response—our quilts,
our bravest poetry, our deaths with grace
 
and dignity have put you in your place.
This elegy itself renounces you,
as from this consciousness you’ve been erased.
The love for you was very strong, the hot
pursuits so many of us reveled in—
but what once felt like love was really not.
I hardly know what I will find to hate
as much as I have loved and hated what
you brought to bear upon my verse, the weight
of your oppression and the joys of truth.

August, goldenrod blowing. We walk
into the graveyard, to find
my grandfather’s grave. Ten years ago
I came here last, bringing
marigolds from the round garden
outside the kitchen.
I didn’t know you then.

among carved names that go with photographs
on top of the piano at the farm:
Keneston, Wells, Fowler, Batchelder, Buck.
We pause at the new grave
of Grace Fenton, my grandfather’s
sister. Last summer
we called on her at the nursing home,
eighty-seven, and nodding
in a blue housedress. We cannot find
my grandfather’s grave.
                                  Back at the house
where no one lives, we potter
and explore the back chamber
where everything comes to rest: spinning wheels,
pretty boxes, quilts,
bottles, books, albums of postcards.
Then with a flashlight we descend
firm steps to the root cellar—black,
cobwebby, huge,
with dirt floors and fieldstone walls,
and above the walls, holding the hewn
sills of the house, enormous
granite foundation stones.
Past the empty bins
for squash, apples, carrots, and potatoes,
we discover the shelves for canning, a few
pale pints
of tomato left, and—what
is this?—syrup, maple syrup
in a quart jar, syrup
my grandfather made twenty-five
years ago
for the last time.
                           I remember
coming to the farm in March
in sugaring time, as a small boy.
He carried the pails of sap, sixteen-quart
buckets, dangling from each end
of a wooden yoke
that lay across his shoulders, and emptied them
into a vat in the saphouse
where fire burned day and night
for a week.
                Now the saphouse
tilts, nearly to the ground,
like someone exhausted
to the point of death, and next winter
when snow piles three feet thick
on the roofs of the cold farm,
the saphouse will shudder and slide
with the snow to the ground.

we take my grandfather’s last
quart of syrup
upstairs, holding it gingerly,
and we wash off twenty-five years
of dirt, and we pull
and pry the lid up, cutting the stiff,
dried rubber gasket, and dip our fingers
in, you and I both, and taste
the sweetness, you for the first time,
the sweetness preserved, of a dead man

when his body slid

When death stands in your doorway, you must show no weakness. If he points at his watch, answer “in five minutes.” If he insists, murmur “just a minute.” When he bridles, whisper “half a minute,”  “a second,” “half a sec,” “one moment.”
You mustn’t look him in the eye. But don’t avert your gaze. Glance decisively at the bridge of the nose or the moist place right below  the lips.
If he unfolds a map, please don’t express a preference for the seashore or the mountains. Betray no longing or anxiety. You might tap the margin nonchalantly, if there is a margin.
There’s an old superstition that death is a healer, he brings peace,  escape from corruption. On the contrary: he is not a person, an animal, an insect, not even a pebble. Not even a name. Not an event. Not a whiff of night air.
So why, ask yourself, does he fidget there, with that peevish “can’t we meet each other halfway” expression, in those absurd Goodwill clothes, baggy corduroy suit, pants and jacket the same color but different wales, so often folded the seams are white as chalk lines, fat two-tone white-and-beige golf shoes with cleats, nylon argyle socks, like someone’s idea of an encyclopedia salesman from the nineteen thirties?
And why is the street behind him so fascinating, empty as a stage set, a few vans double-parked, a cat hiding under one, sometimes the flicker of the tip of a tail, sometimes the glint of the eye itself,  voracious, ecstatic?

See! the hearse leads. I begin with          a design for a hearse. For Christ's sake          not black — nor white either —          and not polished! Let it be weathered —          like a farm wagon — with gilt wheels          (this could be applied fresh          at small expense) or no wheels at all: a rough dray to          drag over the ground. Knock the glass out! My God-glass,          my townspeople! For what purpose?          Is it for the dead to look out or          for us to see how well he is housed          or to see the flowers or          the lack of them — or what? To keep the rain          and snow from him? He will have a          heavier rain soon: pebbles and dirt          and what not. Let there be no glass — and no upholstery          phew! and no little          brass rollers and small easy wheels          on the bottom — my townspeople          what are you thinking of?

No wreathes please — especially no          hot house flowers. Some common memento          is better, something he prized          and is known by: his old clothes —          a few books perhaps — God knows what!          You realize how we are          about these things my townspeople — something will be found —          anything even flowers          if he had come to that. So much for          the hearse. For heaven's sake though          see to the driver! Take off          the silk hat! In fact that's no place          at all for him — up there          unceremoniously dragging our friend out          to his own dignity! Bring him down —          bring him down! Low and inconspicuous!          I'd not have him ride on the wagon at all —          damn him — the undertaker's          understrapper! Let him hold          the reins and walk          at the side and inconspicuously          too! Then briefly          as to yourselves: Walk behind —          as they do in France, seventh class, or          if you ride Hell take curtains!          Go with some show of inconvenience;          sit openly — to the weather          as to grief. Or do you think          you can shut grief in? What — from us?          We who have perhaps nothing to lose?          Share with us share with us —          it will be money in your pockets.                               Go now I think you are          ready.

I The angels guide him now, And watch his curly head, And lead him in their games, The little boy we led.     II He cannot come to harm, He knows more than we know, His light is brighter far Than daytime here below.     III His path leads on and on, Through pleasant lawns and flowers, His brown eyes open wide At grass more green than ours.     IV With playmates like himself, The shining boy will sing, Exploring wondrous woods, Sweet with eternal spring.     V Yet, he is lost to us, Far is his path of gold, Far does the city seem, Lonely our hearts and old.

In the chill rains of the early winter I hear something—
A puling anger, a cold wind stiffened by flying bone—
Out of the north ...
and remember, then, what’s up there:
That ghost-bank: home: Amchitka: boot hill ....
They must be very tired, those ghosts; no flesh sustains them
And the bones rust in the rain.
Reluctant to go into the earth
The skulls gleam: wet; the dog-tag forgets the name;
The statistics (wherein they were young) like their crosses, are weathering out,
They must be very tired.
But I see them riding home,
Nightly: crying weak lust and rage: to stand in the dark,
Forlorn in known rooms, unheard near familiar beds:
Where lie the aging women: who were so lovely: once.

My brother was on his way to a dental appointment when the second plane hit four stories below the office where he worked. He’s never said anything about the guy who took football bets, how he liked to watch his secretary walk, the friends he ate lunch with, all the funerals. Maybe, shamed by his luck, he keeps quiet,afraid someone might guess how good he feels, breathing.

Whip blood up in our cheeks, walk back along

Following the hearse and tinkling village band.
The white October sun circles Kirchstetten
With colours of chrysanthemums in gardens,
And bronze and golden under wiry boughs,
A few last apples gleam like jewels.
Back in the village inn, we sit on benches
For the last toast to you, the honoured ghost
Whose absence now becomes incarnate in us.
Tasting the meats, we imitate your voice
Speaking in flat benign objective tones
The night before you died. In the packed hall
You are your words. Your listeners see
Written on your face the poems they hear
Like letters carved in a tree's bark
The sight and sound of solitudes endured.
And looking down on them, you see
Your image echoed in their eyes
Enchanted by your language to be theirs.
And then, your last word said, halloing hands
Hold up above their heads your farewell bow.
Then many stomp the platform, entreating
Each for his horde, your still warm signing hand.
But you have hidden away in your hotel
And locked the door and lain down on the bed
And fallen from their praise, dead on the floor.

  i. a long voyage, 1621  I left you where you are:A humming late summer afternoon& mottled by shade a man reading a letterBecomes the image of a man readingThat I am forgetting.This page is small yet stout enough To bear me whole upon it to youAll the way in London. I may expand Myself at leisure then fold it tight,A sanctuary;Like our vessel christened The George,My letter is another ark to preserve me: George.No midnight is so private as the sea’s:Timbers breathe, a loose rope snaps, & as the windShoves you behind then slaps your face,Seeing nothing, nothing to be seen, you feelUnhoused, evicted from time.But tonight, my love, my lamp is feathered, shy, Herald of the next ransack & assail. Behold the storm petrel! gray wick-threaded throat Burning the oil secreted, an amber muskOf uncompassed seas & the solitary hunt, Of error & sign, &That delirium—which turnedOur ship’s boy to mowing fields of Atlantic salt.Like windrows he dropped the waves. Until gaffed, pulled like a sleeve Through himself, He will live, tongue-bit, torn.To return likely to a stool set on the shaleWhere he can mend nets skirted by braggartsWho have never traveled fartherThan the smoke dribbling from their chimneys.I try never to imagine drowning.Noisy urgent inefficiencies above, waves Pummeling, sky shredding, & the bodyAnchored only in its just longing for air.The tighter death’s embrace, the more languorousThe moment. So this boy sufferedSome vast charity of sight. He was what he saw, an adam. Now he may be adamant & stain & distance; & also that small satin interruptionOf terror—the instant breath’s Orphaned by self’s perishing through poetry. Like Daphne his voice is forfeit for the song,But we do not grieve for Daphne.My bird-light gutters. Its call had soundedLike dry wood giving up a nail.What is this your wound that you must follow it?For you I had no answer; consider only the reveriesOf the carpet navigator in his room. ListeningTo collisions of wave & star outside his tower,Rock-rapt, icebound, with a mind by dread & ceremony & the dozen arts of courtesy Girded, he invented those ideal earths in latitudesUnstrung that I now trespass—After I had translated two books To the pouring of seas & clamor of sailorsI began to brood long on landlessness, Coming to believe it my sovereign, my home, When on the flat horizon of weeks at noon the flaw:A color merely, private, ethereal, collectingHeft in the warp of time. Days Before we quailed at the barbed illegible peltOf forest, I wrecked, forlorn upon its savor,Sweet damage of apples Fermenting in rain-soaked hay,Giving way to something ranker—I tasted it at dinner lying on my tongue.I am His Majesty’s servant as my god made me;I am also my damps & exaltations; I am afraid.Heaven & hell enlisted their geographers, A map has opened the soul’s five hinges, & PersianWith expectance how often have I feasted On departure. London, Naples, Marriage, Damascus, now your dear person.So much flowing through meMy sight has silted dark my mouth. I begAll the many tongues your wonder cabinet holds—Dolphin, mockingbird, Muscovy bear—to tellThis arrival, so unforeseen, disorderly As my hope you will not forget who I was, & am,Unwildered, unwestered, constant, returning.Bless you where you are, & where you would beWhen you are there, & bring you thither.                                          My love,What may never not be strange? What,This morning, will wake & make me new. ii. winter 1621  It begins like a legend told to a fretful child:It was, it was, and it was not. It beginsAs if with symptoms of that sweatI hear, so late (oh notThank God too late), you were spared:A little blush along the throat. A restlessness.Then the silkworm’s casement, tapering & pale as the egg of a chimney-swift,Which we will convert to cloth To cover the naked Indian. A bobbin,Which dropped in my tisane would ravel the maelstromOf silk. Spindle of whirlwind, spoonfulOf follow. The thread’s stained scalding mile Pours out my glass tempered in our kiln,As each new settler is also seasonedIn this furnace, our new-found land.(As the man drowning believes he digestsThe mild water, as the damned marry flame& yet blister, so do I know myselfGrasped by change at the stroke of change.)Hold this glass up to your eye & throughIts pebbled horizon you may spy your room,See its ire of surfaces sore with chairs. Green grass green grace...Would that I could account this world oneWhere nothing is lost only exchanged.Without coppice, park, romancely glade, Or commanding vantage, Woods press on us; they fester, & they watch. To the northeast white spruce,Phalanxes of fledging pinions, clamp Root to granite & hoardWhat they glean off salt-fog, sea-spray, & stone. From ewers of willow-oaks darkness steams.At breakfast I have pinched the plantlets Insinuated by a maple’s winged seed overnight;It unclasps twin leaves, pale hands Loosening the soil of my rest,They never empty of their solicitations.I find no empires here, no apostles or emeralds.Instead, all things a-broil with an awful begetting& my hours unsettled by some new showOf riotous & mystical imagination.Though we might wish to wedge us barnacle-tightTo shore’s edge, our foundation raisedOn marshland recalls this irritable fact—The estuary, a nursery of strange devices, Throws off new forms so promiscuouslyI wonder how the world holds any more shapeThan a dream?From my hand at night (my lightA little oil in a dish or a rush taper smokingNot so different from his), flower Ovid’s fantastic shapes, shadows Of an old empire’s former splendorNow perjured by Virginia’s clay & leaf & sand Turned to the king’s profit as iron, silk, & glass.Belief is possible at night, solitary, firelit.Then, I can believe in Ovid’s centaurs,Or at death that he was met by a three-headed dog.I can believe in your letters, which never come.It is for you that I persistIn translating fresh birdsong, like this bunting’sComecomecome wherewherewhere All together      down the hill. (Where did they go, who went before us?Starved trove: scatter of blue beads & a nameGrafted to that bald acre. Roanoke.There is my terror & my tale: to go west Under this eternity of nameless trees.)And what will you make of this Humble hieroglyphic of nature I forward to you?Nocturnal, double-wombed, variously calledMonkey Fox; Frosted,Or Short-headed, or Indolent.Let this Leafy-Eared Rat-Tailed ShufflerThe naturals call Possoun Join your zoo’s other fantasies & with the Little Military Learnéd Horse Enjoy its dish of ale. Its fur is durable;Its flesh wholesome, white, & pleasant.With one hand I can reach forA medicine man’s last breath caught in a vialOr a hummingbird, stuffed With arsenic & leaves & looking Like a fine jeweled dagger aimed at my heart, With the other hand I brush away The web spun in a fox skull’s whitened socket While a wild turkey glowers from its cornerLike a small dyspeptic dragon.My cullings do not quite master my closet.When I imagine myself returned to the smells& noise of London, from my stiff kneeSands grinding as I walk, no marvelsExcept those which the mirror surprises in all of us,The swan-white wing at my temple, I do not know what to hope for:That you do not see me, or that you do,But as though I were pinned under glass.At my windowsill a quince widensA jaundiced eye into the dark where areReal nettles beneath the words & invincible redRoot of the madder.

The glories of our blood and state Are shadows, not substantial things; There is no armor against fate; Death lays his icy hand on kings.     Scepter and crown     Must tumble down And in the dust be equal made With the poor crooked scythe and spade. Some men with swords may reap the field And plant fresh laurels where they kill, But their strong nerves at last must yield; They tame but one another still.     Early or late     They stoop to fate And must give up their murmuring breath, When they, pale captives, creep to death. The garlands wither on your brow, Then boast no more your mighty deeds; Upon death’s purple altar now See where the victor-victim bleeds.     Your heads must come     To the cold tomb; Only the actions of the just Smell sweet and blossom in their dust.

To something transcontinental    move by    drawing moonlight out of the great
One-sided stone hung off the starboard wingtip    some sleeper next to
An engine is groaning for coffee    and there is faintly coming in
Somewhere the vast beast-whistle of space. In the galley with its racks
Of trays    she rummages for a blanket    and moves in her slim tailored
Uniform to pin it over the cry at the top of the door. As though she blew
The door down with a silent blast from her lungs    frozen    she is black
Out finding herself    with the plane nowhere and her body taken by the throat
The undying cry of the void    falling    living    beginning to be something
That no one has ever been and lived through    screaming without enough air
Still neat    lipsticked    stockinged    girdled by regulation    her hat
Still on    her arms and legs in no world    and yet spaced also strangely
With utter placid rightness on thin air    taking her time    she holds it
In many places    and now, still thousands of feet from her death she seems
To slow    she develops interest    she turns in her maneuverable body
To watch it. She is hung high up in the overwhelming middle of things in her
Self    in low body-whistling wrapped intensely    in all her dark dance-weight
Coming down from a marvellous leap    with the delaying, dumfounding ease
Of a dream of being drawn    like endless moonlight to the harvest soil
Of a central state of one’s country    with a great gradual warmth coming
Over her    floating    finding more and more breath in what she has been using
For breath    as the levels become more human    seeing clouds placed honestly
Below her left and right    riding slowly toward them    she clasps it all
To her and can hang her hands and feet in it in peculiar ways    and
Her eyes opened wide by wind, can open her mouth as wide    wider and suck
All the heat from the cornfields    can go down on her back with a feeling
Of stupendous pillows stacked under her    and can turn    turn as to someone
In bed    smile, understood in darkness    can go away    slant    slide
Off tumbling    into the emblem of a bird with its wings half-spread
Or whirl madly on herself    in endless gymnastics in the growing warmth
Of wheatfields rising toward the harvest moon.    There is time to live
In superhuman health    seeing mortal unreachable lights far down seeing
An ultimate highway with one late priceless car probing it    arriving

And evil    lying in one after another of all the positions for love

eyesight of owls blazing into the hencoops    a taste for chicken overwhelming
Her    the long-range vision of hawks enlarging all human lights of cars
Freight trains    looped bridges    enlarging the moon racing slowly
Through all the curves of a river    all the darks of the midwest blazing
From above. A rabbit in a bush turns white    the smothering chickens
Huddle    for over them there is still time for something to live
With the streaming half-idea of a long stoop    a hurtling    a fall
That is controlled    that plummets as it wills    turns gravity
Into a new condition, showing its other side like a moon    shining
New Powers    there is still time to live on a breath made of nothing
But the whole night    time for her to remember to arrange her skirt
Like a diagram of a bat    tightly it guides her    she has this flying-skin
Made of garments    and there are also those sky-divers on tv    sailing
In sunlight    smiling under their goggles    swapping batons back and forth

Buddy. She looks for her grinning companion    white teeth    nowhere
She is screaming    singing hymns    her thin human wings spread out
From her neat shoulders    the air beast-crooning to her    warbling

I imagine him because   it is the son’s sorrowful assignment   to imagine his father: there,   hunched on his mount,   with black boots, with bad teeth,   between shifts at the mill,   ripping furrows in the backroads,   past barn and field and silo,   past creek and rock,   past the brown mare,   sleek in her impertinence,   never slowing until he sees   the bull.

I seemed always standing before a door to which I had no key, although I knew it hid behind it a gift for me. Until one day I closed my eyes a moment, stretched then looked once more. And not surprised, I did not mind it when the hinges creaked and, smiling, Death held out his hands to me.

After Walt Whitman



A last formality is
running late, as a life can't,
this hot day. The final
ethereal glow of
the sun seems to come up from
underfoot in this parkland
of polysyllabic death.
 
These deep graves, two this time,
neatly cut into the earth,
await the arrivals,
and two adjacent heaps of
damp fertile glebe are half
blanketed by reticent
dark tarpaulins. After
the full moon's first moments of
horizon-magnified
fact and risen largesse, it
has contracted as our
heaven has passed it by and now
it floats above the crowns
of the inky trees and
well beyond bare roofs. It has
always been an entity
born dead—not a phantom, as
must be this son, a muddy
part of whom soared from cratered
waste lands far away before
landing here, and also
this veteran father,
whose heart staggered into
an ER and failed after
he heard what circumstance
had done to his one boy.
 
No horses—hearses, the first
two cars. A corps of six men—
they bear the heavy coffined
corpse of the father toward his
very small opening in
the planet; and six more
envoys of duty, with
much-practiced attentiveness,
slow-step the light son, an
imperfect cadaver with
handles, to his own last place.
White gloves lift up the draped
famed cloth, super-striped and
starry, from the younger
casket, fold it just so—
hands with hands over hands
in ritual honor,
a ceremony neither
of mystical creed nor
of doubter's midnights—then
they advance it to the one
who remains. She's looking
away from her burials,
down at the blades of moon grass.
She feels no great gut blows
from startled convulsive
big drums that shake the spirits
of mourners, nor any
whirring of equally
perilous small drums that
might reduce the silence.
The son is submitted as
lifeless organism to
dirt; the father’s remains
descend into his pit
alongside, likewise on
tightly held ropes men slowly
let slip. (In foremost ranks of
a final unbecoming
these two fell alike.) The
ropes snake back up into
what's left of natural light—
remainder of the ancient
calculus of day and night.
From a boom box ten paces
away, the familiar
bugled notes say that the
journey of these remains
is done. Even if no grief
shadows the bugler, bugles
do sound it, word it—that
unacceptable sentence
of slow notes.
 
                              Distant, on
overtime, respectful, yet
much too near, a stranger
waits to start up a backhoe.
On such occasions, after
courage of soldiers or
folly of command or cold
wrong purposes among
patriarchs, lords, kings, and freed
madness in red valleys,
mountains, cities, villages,
in schools, shrines, sheds, beds, mud-brick
hearts, we have offered up our
mortally wounded, un-
comprehending remembrance.
We look down or away
and notice the impassive
grass under our bloody weight.

When my brother died
I worried there wasn’t enough time
to deliver the one hundred invitations
I’d scribbled while on the phone with the mortuary:Because of the short notice no need to rsvp.
Unfortunately the firemen couldn’t come.
(I had hoped they’d give free rides on the truck.)
They did agree to drive by the house once
with the lights on— It was a party after all.
I put Mom and Dad in charge of balloons,
let them blow as many years of my brother’s name,
jails, twenty-dollar bills, midnight phone calls,
fistfights, and er visits as they could let go of.
The scarlet balloons zigzagged along the ceiling
like they’d been filled with helium. Mom blew up
so many that she fell asleep. She slept for ten years—
she missed the whole party.
My brothers and sisters were giddy, shredding
his stained T-shirts and raggedy pants, throwing them up
into the air like confetti.
When the clowns came in a few balloons slipped out
the front door. They seemed to know where
they were going and shrank to a fistful of red grins
at the end of our cul-de-sac. The clowns played toy bugles
until the air was scented with rotten raspberries.
They pulled scarves from Mom’s ear—she slept through it.
I baked my brother’s favorite cake (chocolate, white frosting).
When I counted there were ninety-nine of us in the kitchen.
We all stuck our fingers in the mixing bowl.
A few stray dogs came to the window.
I heard their stomachs and mouths growling
over the mariachi band playing in the bathroom.
(There was no room in the hallway because of the magician.)
The mariachis complained about the bathtub acoustics.
I told the dogs, No more cake here, and shut the window.
The fire truck came by with the sirens on. The dogs ran away.
I sliced the cake into ninety-nine pieces.
I wrapped all the electronic equipment in the house,
taped pink bows and glittery ribbons to them—
remote controls, the Polaroid, stereo, Shop-Vac,
even the motor to Dad’s work truck—everything
my brother had taken apart and put back together
doing his crystal meth tricks—he’d always been
a magician of sorts.
Two mutants came to the door.
One looked almost human. They wanted
to know if my brother had willed them the pots
and pans and spoons stacked in his basement bedroom.
They said they missed my brother’s cooking and did we
have any cake. No more cake here, I told them.Well, what’s in the piñata? they asked. I told them
God was and they ran into the desert, barefoot.
I gave Dad his slice and put Mom’s in the freezer.
I brought up the pots and pans and spoons
(really, my brother was a horrible cook), banged them
together like a New Year’s Day celebration.
My brother finally showed up asking why
he hadn’t been invited and who baked the cake.
He told me I shouldn’t smile, that this whole party was shit
because I’d imagined it all. The worst part he said was
he was still alive. The worst part he said was
he wasn’t even dead. I think he’s right, but maybe
the worst part is that I’m still imagining the party, maybe
the worst part is that I can still taste the cake.

all of it a century out of fashion—
all giving way to the quiet rising damp

Traveling through the dark I found a deer
dead on the edge of the Wilson River road.
It is usually best to roll them into the canyon:
that road is narrow; to swerve might make more dead.

I dragged her off; she was large in the belly.
My fingers touching her side brought me the reason—
her side was warm; her fawn lay there waiting,   
alive, still, never to be born.
Beside that mountain road I hesitated.
The car aimed ahead its lowered parking lights;   
under the hood purred the steady engine.
I stood in the glare of the warm exhaust turning red;   
around our group I could hear the wilderness listen.

unwilling to make an investment in her future,

CNN, sitting side by side on the sofa—no teasing, no tattling—

long lines at the gas pump, and even the Rabbi abandoning town.

I’m too embarrassed just now to admit how happy I am
to have them home again, even though they’re only visitors,
no longer “at home.” I built my house too close to the water,
 
my grandmother used to say whenever I went away. She meant
she was easily moved to tears, and it took my own mother years
to teach me the impossibility of protecting the weak
from the strong. Enough crying, she’d say, clicking her tongue
 
like she was contesting the intricate but historical patterns
of sudden death. You don’t die so easily. You have to suffer first.
She meant, I now know, to comfort me, to protect me
from her brother’s tank blown upside down in Germany,
 
the long lines at the gas pumps, the clergy blissfully following
their prayers back home. O but then she’d kiss whatever ailed me,
while my sister railed against injustice, her theme song exploding
above the cushion separating her rights from all I’m still doing wrong.
 How can we expect world peace, my father would have said,

across the world’s stage on an overripe banana—when under one roof my own two children can’t get along.

whistling like Ricky Ricardo, unaware of his wife’s grand schemes,
the well intentioned but certain and coming disaster. Please stay,Grandma, I say, holding her tightly in the aisle, unashamed of my tears.

II Be silent in that solitude,    Which is not loneliness—for then The spirits of the dead who stood    In life before thee are again In death around thee—and their will Shall overshadow thee: be still.        III The night, tho’ clear, shall frown— And the stars shall look not down From their high thrones in the heaven, With light like Hope to mortals given— But their red orbs, without beam, To thy weariness shall seem As a burning and a fever Which would cling to thee for ever.        IV Now are thoughts thou shalt not banish, Now are visions ne’er to vanish; From thy spirit shall they pass No more—like dew-drop from the grass.

PART I 'Tis the middle of night by the castle clock, And the owls have awakened the crowing cock; Tu—whit! Tu—whoo! And hark, again! the crowing cock, How drowsily it crew. Sir Leoline, the Baron rich, Hath a toothless mastiff bitch; From her kennel beneath the rock She maketh answer to the clock, Four for the quarters, and twelve for the hour; Ever and aye, by shine and shower, Sixteen short howls, not over loud; Some say, she sees my lady's shroud. Is the night chilly and dark? The night is chilly, but not dark. The thin gray cloud is spread on high, It covers but not hides the sky. The moon is behind, and at the full; And yet she looks both small and dull. The night is chill, the cloud is gray: 'Tis a month before the month of May, And the Spring comes slowly up this way. The lovely lady, Christabel, Whom her father loves so well, What makes her in the wood so late, A furlong from the castle gate? She had dreams all yesternight Of her own betrothèd knight; And she in the midnight wood will pray For the weal of her lover that's far away. She stole along, she nothing spoke, The sighs she heaved were soft and low, And naught was green upon the oak But moss and rarest misletoe: She kneels beneath the huge oak tree, And in silence prayeth she. The lady sprang up suddenly, The lovely lady Christabel! It moaned as near, as near can be, But what it is she cannot tell.— On the other side it seems to be, Of the huge, broad-breasted, old oak tree. The night is chill; the forest bare; Is it the wind that moaneth bleak? There is not wind enough in the air To move away the ringlet curl From the lovely lady's cheek— There is not wind enough to twirl The one red leaf, the last of its clan, That dances as often as dance it can, Hanging so light, and hanging so high, On the topmost twig that looks up at the sky. Hush, beating heart of Christabel! Jesu, Maria, shield her well! She folded her arms beneath her cloak, And stole to the other side of the oak.        What sees she there? There she sees a damsel bright, Drest in a silken robe of white, That shadowy in the moonlight shone: The neck that made that white robe wan, Her stately neck, and arms were bare; Her blue-veined feet unsandl'd were, And wildly glittered here and there The gems entangled in her hair. I guess, 'twas frightful there to see A lady so richly clad as she— Beautiful exceedingly! Mary mother, save me now! (Said Christabel) And who art thou? The lady strange made answer meet, And her voice was faint and sweet:— Have pity on my sore distress, I scarce can speak for weariness: Stretch forth thy hand, and have no fear! Said Christabel, How camest thou here? And the lady, whose voice was faint and sweet, Did thus pursue her answer meet:— My sire is of a noble line, And my name is Geraldine: Five warriors seized me yestermorn, Me, even me, a maid forlorn: They choked my cries with force and fright, And tied me on a palfrey white. The palfrey was as fleet as wind, And they rode furiously behind. They spurred amain, their steeds were white: And once we crossed the shade of night. As sure as Heaven shall rescue me, I have no thought what men they be; Nor do I know how long it is (For I have lain entranced I wis) Since one, the tallest of the five, Took me from the palfrey's back, A weary woman, scarce alive. Some muttered words his comrades spoke: He placed me underneath this oak; He swore they would return with haste; Whither they went I cannot tell— I thought I heard, some minutes past, Sounds as of a castle bell. Stretch forth thy hand (thus ended she). And help a wretched maid to flee. Then Christabel stretched forth her hand, And comforted fair Geraldine: O well, bright dame! may you command The service of Sir Leoline; And gladly our stout chivalry Will he send forth and friends withal To guide and guard you safe and free Home to your noble father's hall. She rose: and forth with steps they passed That strove to be, and were not, fast. Her gracious stars the lady blest, And thus spake on sweet Christabel: All our household are at rest, The hall as silent as the cell; Sir Leoline is weak in health, And may not well awakened be, But we will move as if in stealth, And I beseech your courtesy, This night, to share your couch with me. They crossed the moat, and Christabel Took the key that fitted well; A little door she opened straight, All in the middle of the gate; The gate that was ironed within and without, Where an army in battle array had marched out. The lady sank, belike through pain, And Christabel with might and main Lifted her up, a weary weight, Over the threshold of the gate: Then the lady rose again, And moved, as she were not in pain. So free from danger, free from fear, They crossed the court: right glad they were. And Christabel devoutly cried To the lady by her side, Praise we the Virgin all divine Who hath rescued thee from thy distress! Alas, alas! said Geraldine, I cannot speak for weariness. So free from danger, free from fear, They crossed the court: right glad they were. Outside her kennel, the mastiff old Lay fast asleep, in moonshine cold. The mastiff old did not awake, Yet she an angry moan did make! And what can ail the mastiff bitch? Never till now she uttered yell Beneath the eye of Christabel. Perhaps it is the owlet's scritch: For what can ail the mastiff bitch? They passed the hall, that echoes still, Pass as lightly as you will! The brands were flat, the brands were dying, Amid their own white ashes lying; But when the lady passed, there came A tongue of light, a fit of flame; And Christabel saw the lady's eye, And nothing else saw she thereby, Save the boss of the shield of Sir Leoline tall, Which hung in a murky old niche in the wall. O softly tread, said Christabel, My father seldom sleepeth well. Sweet Christabel her feet doth bare, And jealous of the listening air They steal their way from stair to stair, Now in glimmer, and now in gloom, And now they pass the Baron's room, As still as death, with stifled breath! And now have reached her chamber door; And now doth Geraldine press down The rushes of the chamber floor. The moon shines dim in the open air, And not a moonbeam enters here. But they without its light can see The chamber carved so curiously, Carved with figures strange and sweet, All made out of the carver's brain, For a lady's chamber meet: The lamp with twofold silver chain Is fastened to an angel's feet. The silver lamp burns dead and dim; But Christabel the lamp will trim. She trimmed the lamp, and made it bright, And left it swinging to and fro, While Geraldine, in wretched plight, Sank down upon the floor below. O weary lady, Geraldine, I pray you, drink this cordial wine! It is a wine of virtuous powers; My mother made it of wild flowers. And will your mother pity me, Who am a maiden most forlorn? Christabel answered—Woe is me! She died the hour that I was born. I have heard the grey-haired friar tell How on her death-bed she did say, That she should hear the castle-bell Strike twelve upon my wedding-day. O mother dear! that thou wert here! I would, said Geraldine, she were! But soon with altered voice, said she— 'Off, wandering mother! Peak and pine! I have power to bid thee flee.' Alas! what ails poor Geraldine? Why stares she with unsettled eye? Can she the bodiless dead espy? And why with hollow voice cries she, 'Off, woman, off! this hour is mine— Though thou her guardian spirit be, Off, woman, off! 'tis given to me.' Then Christabel knelt by the lady's side, And raised to heaven her eyes so blue— Alas! said she, this ghastly ride— Dear lady! it hath wildered you! The lady wiped her moist cold brow, And faintly said, ' 'tis over now!' Again the wild-flower wine she drank: Her fair large eyes 'gan glitter bright, And from the floor whereon she sank, The lofty lady stood upright: She was most beautiful to see, Like a lady of a far countrèe. And thus the lofty lady spake— 'All they who live in the upper sky, Do love you, holy Christabel! And you love them, and for their sake And for the good which me befel, Even I in my degree will try, Fair maiden, to requite you well. But now unrobe yourself; for I Must pray, ere yet in bed I lie.' Quoth Christabel, So let it be! And as the lady bade, did she. Her gentle limbs did she undress, And lay down in her loveliness. But through her brain of weal and woe So many thoughts moved to and fro, That vain it were her lids to close; So half-way from the bed she rose, And on her elbow did recline To look at the lady Geraldine. Beneath the lamp the lady bowed, And slowly rolled her eyes around; Then drawing in her breath aloud, Like one that shuddered, she unbound The cincture from beneath her breast: Her silken robe, and inner vest, Dropt to her feet, and full in view, Behold! her bosom and half her side— A sight to dream of, not to tell! O shield her! shield sweet Christabel! Yet Geraldine nor speaks nor stirs; Ah! what a stricken look was hers! Deep from within she seems half-way To lift some weight with sick assay, And eyes the maid and seeks delay; Then suddenly, as one defied, Collects herself in scorn and pride, And lay down by the Maiden's side!— And in her arms the maid she took,        Ah wel-a-day! And with low voice and doleful look These words did say: 'In the touch of this bosom there worketh a spell, Which is lord of thy utterance, Christabel! Thou knowest to-night, and wilt know to-morrow, This mark of my shame, this seal of my sorrow;        But vainly thou warrest,                For this is alone in        Thy power to declare,                That in the dim forest        Thou heard'st a low moaning, And found'st a bright lady, surpassingly fair; And didst bring her home with thee in love and in charity, To shield her and shelter her from the damp air.' THE CONCLUSION TO PART I It was a lovely sight to see The lady Christabel, when she Was praying at the old oak tree.        Amid the jaggèd shadows        Of mossy leafless boughs,        Kneeling in the moonlight,        To make her gentle vows; Her slender palms together prest, Heaving sometimes on her breast; Her face resigned to bliss or bale— Her face, oh call it fair not pale, And both blue eyes more bright than clear, Each about to have a tear. With open eyes (ah woe is me!) Asleep, and dreaming fearfully, Fearfully dreaming, yet, I wis, Dreaming that alone, which is— O sorrow and shame! Can this be she, The lady, who knelt at the old oak tree? And lo! the worker of these harms, That holds the maiden in her arms, Seems to slumber still and mild, As a mother with her child. A star hath set, a star hath risen, O Geraldine! since arms of thine Have been the lovely lady's prison. O Geraldine! one hour was thine— Thou'st had thy will! By tairn and rill, The night-birds all that hour were still. But now they are jubilant anew, From cliffand tower, tu—whoo! tu—whoo! Tu—whoo! tu—whoo! from wood and fell! And see! the lady Christabel Gathers herself from out her trance; Her limbs relax, her countenance Grows sad and soft; the smooth thin lids Close o'er her eyes; and tears she sheds— Large tears that leave the lashes bright! And oft the while she seems to smile As infants at a sudden light! Yea, she doth smile, and she doth weep, Like a youthful hermitess, Beauteous in a wilderness, Who, praying always, prays in sleep. And, if she move unquietly, Perchance, 'tis but the blood so free Comes back and tingles in her feet. No doubt, she hath a vision sweet. What if her guardian spirit 'twere, What if she knew her mother near? But this she knows, in joys and woes, That saints will aid if men will call: For the blue sky bends over all! PART II Each matin bell, the Baron saith, Knells us back to a world of death. These words Sir Leoline first said, When he rose and found his lady dead: These words Sir Leoline will say Many a morn to his dying day! And hence the custom and law began That still at dawn the sacristan, Who duly pulls the heavy bell, Five and forty beads must tell Between each stroke—a warning knell, Which not a soul can choose but hear From Bratha Head to Wyndermere. Saith Bracy the bard, So let it knell! And let the drowsy sacristan Still count as slowly as he can! There is no lack of such, I ween, As well fill up the space between. In Langdale Pike and Witch's Lair, And Dungeon-ghyll so foully rent, With ropes of rock and bells of air Three sinful sextons' ghosts are pent, Who all give back, one after t'other, The death-note to their living brother; And oft too, by the knell offended, Just as their one! two! three! is ended, The devil mocks the doleful tale With a merry peal from Borodale. The air is still! through mist and cloud That merry peal comes ringing loud; And Geraldine shakes off her dread, And rises lightly from the bed; Puts on her silken vestments white, And tricks her hair in lovely plight, And nothing doubting of her spell Awakens the lady Christabel. 'Sleep you, sweet lady Christabel? I trust that you have rested well.' And Christabel awoke and spied The same who lay down by her side— O rather say, the same whom she Raised up beneath the old oak tree! Nay, fairer yet! and yet more fair! For she belike hath drunken deep Of all the blessedness of sleep! And while she spake, her looks, her air Such gentle thankfulness declare, That (so it seemed) her girded vests Grew tight beneath her heaving breasts. 'Sure I have sinn'd!' said Christabel, 'Now heaven be praised if all be well!' And in low faltering tones, yet sweet, Did she the lofty lady greet With such perplexity of mind As dreams too lively leave behind. So quickly she rose, and quickly arrayed Her maiden limbs, and having prayed That He, who on the cross did groan, Might wash away her sins unknown, She forthwith led fair Geraldine To meet her sire, Sir Leoline. The lovely maid and the lady tall Are pacing both into the hall, And pacing on through page and groom, Enter the Baron's presence-room. The Baron rose, and while he prest His gentle daughter to his breast, With cheerful wonder in his eyes The lady Geraldine espies, And gave such welcome to the same, As might beseem so bright a dame! But when he heard the lady's tale, And when she told her father's name, Why waxed Sir Leoline so pale, Murmuring o'er the name again, Lord Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine? Alas! they had been friends in youth; But whispering tongues can poison truth; And constancy lives in realms above; And life is thorny; and youth is vain; And to be wroth with one we love Doth work like madness in the brain. And thus it chanced, as I divine, With Roland and Sir Leoline. Each spake words of high disdain And insult to his heart's best brother: They parted—ne'er to meet again! But never either found another To free the hollow heart from paining— They stood aloof, the scars remaining, Like cliffs which had been rent asunder; A dreary sea now flows between;— But neither heat, nor frost, nor thunder, Shall wholly do away, I ween, The marks of that which once hath been. Sir Leoline, a moment's space, Stood gazing on the damsel's face: And the youthful Lord of Tryermaine Came back upon his heart again. O then the Baron forgot his age, His noble heart swelled high with rage; He swore by the wounds in Jesu's side He would proclaim it far and wide, With trump and solemn heraldry, That they, who thus had wronged the dame, Were base as spotted infamy! 'And if they dare deny the same, My herald shall appoint a week, And let the recreant traitors seek My tourney court—that there and then I may dislodge their reptile souls From the bodies and forms of men!' He spake: his eye in lightning rolls! For the lady was ruthlessly seized; and he kenned In the beautiful lady the child of his friend! And now the tears were on his face, And fondly in his arms he took Fair Geraldine, who met the embrace, Prolonging it with joyous look. Which when she viewed, a vision fell Upon the soul of Christabel, The vision of fear, the touch and pain! She shrunk and shuddered, and saw again— (Ah, woe is me! Was it for thee, Thou gentle maid! such sights to see?) Again she saw that bosom old, Again she felt that bosom cold, And drew in her breath with a hissing sound: Whereat the Knight turned wildly round, And nothing saw, but his own sweet maid With eyes upraised, as one that prayed. The touch, the sight, had passed away, And in its stead that vision blest, Which comforted her after-rest While in the lady's arms she lay, Had put a rapture in her breast, And on her lips and o'er her eyes Spread smiles like light!                       With new surprise, 'What ails then my belovèd child? The Baron said—His daughter mild Made answer, 'All will yet be well!' I ween, she had no power to tell Aught else: so mighty was the spell. Yet he, who saw this Geraldine, Had deemed her sure a thing divine: Such sorrow with such grace she blended, As if she feared she had offended Sweet Christabel, that gentle maid! And with such lowly tones she prayed She might be sent without delay Home to her father's mansion.                       'Nay! Nay, by my soul!' said Leoline. 'Ho! Bracy the bard, the charge be thine! Go thou, with sweet music and loud, And take two steeds with trappings proud, And take the youth whom thou lov'st best To bear thy harp, and learn thy song, And clothe you both in solemn vest, And over the mountains haste along, Lest wandering folk, that are abroad, Detain you on the valley road. 'And when he has crossed the Irthing flood, My merry bard! he hastes, he hastes Up Knorren Moor, through Halegarth Wood, And reaches soon that castle good Which stands and threatens Scotland's wastes. 'Bard Bracy! bard Bracy! your horses are fleet, Ye must ride up the hall, your music so sweet, More loud than your horses' echoing feet! And loud and loud to Lord Roland call, Thy daughter is safe in Langdale hall! Thy beautiful daughter is safe and free— Sir Leoline greets thee thus through me! He bids thee come without delay With all thy numerous array And take thy lovely daughter home: And he will meet thee on the way With all his numerous array White with their panting palfreys' foam: And, by mine honour! I will say, That I repent me of the day When I spake words of fierce disdain To Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine!— —For since that evil hour hath flown, Many a summer's sun hath shone; Yet ne'er found I a friend again Like Roland de Vaux of Tryermaine. The lady fell, and clasped his knees, Her face upraised, her eyes o'erflowing; And Bracy replied, with faltering voice, His gracious Hail on all bestowing!— 'Thy words, thou sire of Christabel, Are sweeter than my harp can tell; Yet might I gain a boon of thee, This day my journey should not be, So strange a dream hath come to me, That I had vowed with music loud To clear yon wood from thing unblest. Warned by a vision in my rest! For in my sleep I saw that dove, That gentle bird, whom thou dost love, And call'st by thy own daughter's name— Sir Leoline! I saw the same Fluttering, and uttering fearful moan, Among the green herbs in the forest alone. Which when I saw and when I heard, I wonder'd what might ail the bird; For nothing near it could I see Save the grass and green herbs underneath the old tree. 'And in my dream methought I went To search out what might there be found; And what the sweet bird's trouble meant, That thus lay fluttering on the ground. I went and peered, and could descry No cause for her distressful cry; But yet for her dear lady's sake I stooped, methought, the dove to take, When lo! I saw a bright green snake Coiled around its wings and neck. Green as the herbs on which it couched, Close by the dove's its head it crouched; And with the dove it heaves and stirs, Swelling its neck as she swelled hers! I woke; it was the midnight hour, The clock was echoing in the tower; But though my slumber was gone by, This dream it would not pass away— It seems to live upon my eye! And thence I vowed this self-same day With music strong and saintly song To wander through the forest bare, Lest aught unholy loiter there.' Thus Bracy said: the Baron, the while, Half-listening heard him with a smile; Then turned to Lady Geraldine, His eyes made up of wonder and love; And said in courtly accents fine, 'Sweet maid, Lord Roland's beauteous dove, With arms more strong than harp or song, Thy sire and I will crush the snake!' He kissed her forehead as he spake, And Geraldine in maiden wise Casting down her large bright eyes, With blushing cheek and courtesy fine She turned her from Sir Leoline; Softly gathering up her train, That o'er her right arm fell again; And folded her arms across her chest, And couched her head upon her breast, And looked askance at Christabel Jesu, Maria, shield her well! A snake's small eye blinks dull and shy; And the lady's eyes they shrunk in her head, Each shrunk up to a serpent's eye And with somewhat of malice, and more of dread, At Christabel she looked askance!— One moment—and the sight was fled! But Christabel in dizzy trance Stumbling on the unsteady ground Shuddered aloud, with a hissing sound; And Geraldine again turned round, And like a thing, that sought relief, Full of wonder and full of grief, She rolled her large bright eyes divine Wildly on Sir Leoline. The maid, alas! her thoughts are gone, She nothing sees—no sight but one! The maid, devoid of guile and sin, I know not how, in fearful wise, So deeply she had drunken in That look, those shrunken serpent eyes, That all her features were resigned To this sole image in her mind: And passively did imitate That look of dull and treacherous hate! And thus she stood, in dizzy trance; Still picturing that look askance With forced unconscious sympathy Full before her father's view— As far as such a look could be In eyes so innocent and blue! And when the trance was o'er, the maid Paused awhile, and inly prayed: Then falling at the Baron's feet, 'By my mother's soul do I entreat That thou this woman send away!' She said: and more she could not say: For what she knew she could not tell, O'er-mastered by the mighty spell. Why is thy cheek so wan and wild, Sir Leoline? Thy only child Lies at thy feet, thy joy, thy pride, So fair, so innocent, so mild; The same, for whom thy lady died! O by the pangs of her dear mother Think thou no evil of thy child! For her, and thee, and for no other, She prayed the moment ere she died: Prayed that the babe for whom she died, Might prove her dear lord's joy and pride!        That prayer her deadly pangs beguiled,                Sir Leoline!        And wouldst thou wrong thy only child,                Her child and thine? Within the Baron's heart and brain If thoughts, like these, had any share, They only swelled his rage and pain, And did but work confusion there. His heart was cleft with pain and rage, His cheeks they quivered, his eyes were wild, Dishonoured thus in his old age; Dishonoured by his only child, And all his hospitality To the wronged daughter of his friend By more than woman's jealousy Brought thus to a disgraceful end— He rolled his eye with stern regard Upon the gentle minstrel bard, And said in tones abrupt, austere— 'Why, Bracy! dost thou loiter here? I bade thee hence!' The bard obeyed; And turning from his own sweet maid, The agèd knight, Sir Leoline, Led forth the lady Geraldine! THE CONCLUSION TO PART II A little child, a limber elf, Singing, dancing to itself, A fairy thing with red round cheeks, That always finds, and never seeks, Makes such a vision to the sight As fills a father's eyes with light; And pleasures flow in so thick and fast Upon his heart, that he at last Must needs express his love's excess With words of unmeant bitterness. Perhaps 'tis pretty to force together Thoughts so all unlike each other; To mutter and mock a broken charm, To dally with wrong that does no harm. Perhaps 'tis tender too and pretty At each wild word to feel within A sweet recoil of love and pity. And what, if in a world of sin (O sorrow and shame should this be true!) Such giddiness of heart and brain Comes seldom save from rage and pain, So talks as it 's most used to do.

Anghiari is medieval, a sleeve sloping down   
A steep hill, suddenly sweeping out
To the edge of a cliff, and dwindling.
But far up the mountain, behind the town,   
We too were swept out, out by the wind,   
Alone with the Tuscan grass.
Wind had been blowing across the hills
For days, and everything now was graying gold   
With dust, everything we saw, even
Some small children scampering along a road,   
Twittering Italian to a small caged bird.   
We sat beside them to rest in some brushwood,   
And I leaned down to rinse the dust from my face.
I found the spider web there, whose hinges   
Reeled heavily and crazily with the dust,
Whole mounds and cemeteries of it, sagging   
And scattering shadows among shells and wings.   
And then she stepped into the center of air   
Slender and fastidious, the golden hair
Of daylight along her shoulders, she poised there,   
While ruins crumbled on every side of her.   
Free of the dust, as though a moment before   
She had stepped inside the earth, to bathe herself.
I gazed, close to her, till at last she stepped   
Away in her own good time.
Many men
Have searched all over Tuscany and never found   
What I found there, the heart of the light   
Itself shelled and leaved, balancing   
On filaments themselves falling. The secret
Of this journey is to let the wind   
Blow its dust all over your body,
To let it go on blowing, to step lightly, lightly
All the way through your ruins, and not to lose
Any sleep over the dead, who surely   
Will bury their own, don’t worry.

                    The Ballad of Blasphemous Bill
                ","
I took a contract to bury the body of blasphemous Bill MacKie,
Whenever, wherever or whatsoever the manner of death he die —
Whether he die in the light o’ day or under the peak-faced moon;
In cabin or dance-hall, camp or dive, mucklucks or patent shoon;
On velvet tundra or virgin peak, by glacier, drift or draw;
In muskeg hollow or canyon gloom, by avalanche, fang or claw;
By battle, murder or sudden wealth, by pestilence, hooch or lead —
I swore on the Book I would follow and look till I found my tombless dead.
For Bill was a dainty kind of cuss, and his mind was mighty sot
On a dinky patch with flowers and grass in a civilized boneyard lot.
And where he died or how he died, it didn’t matter a damn
So long as he had a grave with frills and a tombstone “epigram.”
So I promised him, and he paid the price in good cheechako coin
(Which the same I blowed in that very night down in the Tenderloin).
Then I painted a three-foot slab of pine: “Here lies poor Bill MacKie,”
And I hung it up on my cabin wall and I waited for Bill to die.
Years passed away, and at last one day came a squaw with a story strange,
Of a long-deserted line of traps ’way back of the Bighorn range,
Of a little hut by the great divide, and a white man stiff and still,
Lying there by his lonesome self, and I figured it must be Bill.
So I thought of the contract I’d made with him, and I took down from the shelf
The swell black box with the silver plate he’d picked out for hisself;
And I packed it full of grub and “hooch,” and I slung it on the sleigh;
Then I harnessed up my team of dogs and was off at dawn of day.
You know what it’s like in the Yukon wild when it’s sixty-nine below;
When the ice-worms wriggle their purple heads through the crust of the pale blue snow;
When the pine-trees crack like little guns in the silence of the wood,
And the icicles hang down like tusks under the parka hood;
When the stove-pipe smoke breaks sudden off, and the sky is weirdly lit,
And the careless feel of a bit of steel burns like a red-hot spit;
When the mercury is a frozen ball, and the frost-fiend stalks to kill —
Well, it was just like that that day when I set out to look for Bill.
Oh, the awful hush that seemed to crush me down on every hand,
As I blundered blind with a trail to find through that blank and bitter land;
Half dazed, half crazed in the winter wild, with its grim heartbreaking woes,
And the ruthless strife for a grip on life that only the sourdough knows!
North by the compass, North I pressed; river and peak and plain
Passed like a dream I slept to lose and I waked to dream again.
River and plain and mighty peak — and who could stand unawed?
As their summits blazed, he could stand undazed at the foot of the throne of God.
North, aye, North, through a land accurst, shunned by the scouring brutes,
And all I heard was my own harsh word and the whine of the malamutes,
Till at last I came to a cabin squat, built in the side of a hill,
And I burst in the door, and there on the floor, frozen to death, lay Bill.
Ice, white ice, like a winding-sheet, sheathing each smoke-grimed wall;
Ice on the stove-pipe, ice on the bed, ice gleaming over all;
Sparkling ice on the dead man’s chest, glittering ice in his hair,
Ice on his fingers, ice in his heart, ice in his glassy stare;
Hard as a log and trussed like a frog, with his arms and legs outspread.
I gazed at the coffin I’d brought for him, and I gazed at the gruesome dead,
And at last I spoke: “Bill liked his joke; but still, goldarn his eyes,
A man had ought to consider his mates in the way he goes and dies.”
Have you ever stood in an Arctic hut in the shadow of the Pole,
With a little coffin six by three and a grief you can’t control?
Have you ever sat by a frozen corpse that looks at you with a grin,
And that seems to say: “You may try all day, but you’ll never jam me in”?
I’m not a man of the quitting kind, but I never felt so blue
As I sat there gazing at that stiff and studying what I’d do.
Then I rose and I kicked off the husky dogs that were nosing round about,
And I lit a roaring fire in the stove, and I started to thaw Bill out.
Well, I thawed and thawed for thirteen days, but it didn’t seem no good;
His arms and legs stuck out like pegs, as if they was made of wood.
Till at last I said: “It ain’t no use — he’s froze too hard to thaw;
He’s obstinate, and he won’t lie straight, so I guess I got to — saw.”
So I sawed off poor Bill’s arms and legs, and I laid him snug and straight
In the little coffin he picked hisself, with the dinky silver plate,
And I came nigh near to shedding a tear as I nailed him safely down;
Then I stowed him away in my Yukon sleigh, and I started back to town.
So I buried him as the contract was in a narrow grave and deep,
And there he’s waiting the Great Clean-up, when the Judgment sluice-heads sweep;
And I smoke my pipe and I meditate in the light of the Midnight Sun,
And sometimes I wonder if they was, the awful things I done.
And as I sit and the parson talks, expounding of the Law,
I often think of poor old Bill — and how hard he was to saw.

As I wandered on the beach
I saw the heron standing   
Sunk in the tattered wings
He wore as a hunchback’s coat.   
Shadow without a shadow,   
Hung on invisible wires   
From the top of a canvas day,   
What scissors cut him out?   
Superimposed on a poster   
Of summer by the strand   
Of a long-decayed resort,   
Poised in the dusty light   
Some fifteen summers ago;   
I wondered, an empty child,   
“Heron, whose ghost are you?”
I stood on the beach alone,
In the sudden chill of the burned.
My thought raced up the path.   
Pursuing it, I ran
To my mother in the house
And led her to the scene.
The spectral bird was gone.
But her quick eye saw him drifting   
Over the highest pines
On vast, unmoving wings.
Could they be those ashen things,   
So grounded, unwieldy, ragged,   
A pair of broken arms
That were not made for flight?   
In the middle of my loss
I realized she knew:
My mother knew what he was.
O great blue heron, now
That the summer house has burned   
So many rockets ago,
So many smokes and fires
And beach-lights and water-glow   
Reflecting pinwheel and flare:   
The old logs hauled away,   
The pines and driftwood cleared   
From that bare strip of shore   
Where dozens of children play;   
Now there is only you
Heavy upon my eye.
Why have you followed me here,   
Heavy and far away?
You have stood there patiently   
For fifteen summers and snows,   
Denser than my repose,
Bleaker than any dream,
Waiting upon the day
When, like grey smoke, a vapor   
Floating into the sky,
A handful of paper ashes,
My mother would drift away.

They carry them off like warriors on their steel

so that every part will be of service. I think of
my husband at his father’s grave—
the grass had closed
over the headstone, and the name had disappeared. He took out
his pocket knife and cut the grass away, he swept it

we’ll be forgotten?” And he bent down over the grave and wept.

     I. The Spirit Box
 
Son:
 A son is a steadfast keeper of secrets,
 a cupped palm, a calyx,a son is a spirit box, listen—
 
I was born after armistice,
the fissured cities,
 
but slept nights
with a human smoke.
 
And though I never shuddered
from a black rouge
 
of rationed coffee
to keep clean,
 
the frost and sullen mud
of a forced march,
 
the unspoken, the unspeakable,
became my life:
 
I was a boy bathed in dreams
by a menorah fashioned against
 
the penalty of death,
a mysterious klezmer.
 A son is a spirit box, imagine.
 
 
     II. Riders on the Back of Silence
 
Son:
 
As a boy, my old-world aunts and uncles
would weep when I entered the room:
 
What did I have to do with sadness?
Their cryptic tears
 
and purse-tucked Kleenex
were my own tantalizing
 
Hardy Boys case to crack.
Gradually, as a junior detective, I grasped
 
how much I resembled
an uncle lost in the war,
 
and like the savvy, querying boy
at the Passover Seder
 
become a scrupulous man,
an inquisitive reporter,
 
I set out to track my look-alike’s,
my family’s wartime destiny—
 
What my father marshaled against,
what my mother endured,
 
the unspoken, the unspeakable,
became my mission:
 
though I was born in a venomless
time and suburb,
 
phantoms, chimeras breathed
in our never-quite-here-and-now house,
 
secret calendars of fire:
Mother, I dreamed we were
 
riders on the back of silence,
the wild unsaid beneath us:
 horse, whale,behemoth.
 
We never spoke of the war.
So with stark reading,

Garrisons, watchtowers,
checkpoints as daunting as Gorgons,
 
proliferated.
The borders became too-tight belts—
 
Long after the white of truce,

Soft as a fontanel,Dove was the pet name

its bolstering sweetness
 
became my talisman.
It was with me, mitigating, winged,
 
shielding me somehow,
as my lover Jaeger’s lens shattered
 
and his lifeblood
soaked into my shirt.
 
It was with me,
a thousand leagues from God,

Today, amid the earliest birdcalls, the first
neighborhood sounds,
 
I swept the stoop,
leaned on the trusty broom,
 
and wondered:
If I could write, son, about those years,
 
where would I begin?—
Your grandfather was a stationmaster,
 
tall as a flagpole
and as taciturn.
 
And though his owl-gray eyes
have gone to earth,
 
I keep thinking he’ll round the corner
in his fastidious clothes,
 
carrying a sprig of asphodel
or fragrant honeysuckle—
 
so dignified with his gold
spectacles and timetables.
 
God took him the Sabbath before
the shouts and stones, the smashed
 
storefronts of Kristallnacht.
How it would’ve angered him to see
 
that his beloved trains
were used to betray us.
 
 
     VII. Dove’s Arc
 
Mother:
 
For years I dreamed maternal dreams
of your cozy security—
 
spacious freedom from pogroms,
all the misery the wide,
 
unmerciful world doles out
to Jews and scapegoats,
 
and always you seemed
determined to court danger—
 
So you want to know
about a prisoner’s,
 
a Häftling’s dignity?
This is what it meant:
 
at the roll call,
some anchoring wish—
 
or a shared shoe,
a black rouge of rationed
 
coffee in the camp,
to dodge selection for the flames ...
 
Truth to tell:
there’s barely been a day
 
when the filth of the barracks,
the fury of the camps
 
didn’t obsess my heart;
But I will go with you to Birkenau,
 
near the slain beasts
of the old crematoriums,
 
where everywhere you walk,
you are walking on human ash.
 
I want to leave something
sturdy in this world,
 
maybe a book
of live-to-tell truth,
 
grace and vitamins,
for those to come.
 
More than anything, son,
what I’ve wanted to tell you:
 
there was a woman of courage
in the camp,
 
and she shepherded me,
kindled me to keep me alive.
 
A clear light seemed to shore her
(as if we were seeing
 
a one-woman sunrise,
an unstoppable human dawn),
 
so that she garnered strength to share
her meager scraps,
 
strength to carry the ones
still minus an alphabet,
 
making up soothing rhymes,
little puddles of sound...
 
Like so many,
she died of typhus.
 
And after liberation,
in the DP camp,
 
amid the chaos, I prayed
my children would inherit
 
a portion of her spirit.
And it’s true,
 
you have some of her fearlessness,
her passion, you do.
 
Son, why didn’t I see it before?
How my hardscrabble prayer,
 
in it’s dove’s arc,
was answered.

Father, where do the wild swans go?         Far, far. Ceaselessly winging,         Their necks outstraining, they haste them singing         Far, far. Whither, none may know.Father, where do the cloud-ships go?         Far, far. The winds pursue them,         And over the shining heaven strew them         Far, far. Whither, none may know.Father, where do the days all go?         Far, far. Each runs and races—         No one can catch them, they leave no traces—         Far, far. Whither, none may know.But father, we—where do we then go?         Far, far. Our dim eyes veiling,         With bended head we go sighing, wailing         Far, far. Whither none may know.

Your parents had reached a long slow time,
as animals do, the great center of their lives,
when they gleam in their fells as though eternally,
unchanging. Or as a day can seem eternal
if you lie and watch the full clouds, conscious
of your own time: you soon must get up and leave.
So father, mother, the small shabby town,
its patch of earth going on as though forever: you
forgot them there, where they’d been since you started out
and where you could find them again—as anyone
forgets what he has to lean on
so deeply and heavily that it wounds his side
and the pain seems only himself.
Ungrateful? So you accused yourself one day,
waking suddenly. And when you went at last
to look for them where they always are, they’d gone,
or were withered alive, their mouths opening and closing
without sound. The buildings had leaned still farther
toward the dusty weeds and crumbs of old machines
littered everywhere inexplicably. And now
who will explain them? Your grandfather’s day
is as absent from your thought as is your own
gestation. And check the records:
what is written down says nothing.
The volumes all avoid the one question you have.
They’re like the notebooks you kept in adolescence:
you turn the endless pages and you wonder,
what did I know or feel, how did I live then,
what was this violence and love, this utter newness,
invention that could sing water and light, raging
at the first touch of dying, never mentioning death?
You went back and the bones of your native town
were like that, records from which something had escaped:
a skeletal mill that roofed ghostly technologies
where men once worked, coughed, burnt, bled.
And that way they had permitted the long pageants
of the children. And their mothers—whose images,
vague, identical, stalk by in the nights,
each one sorrowing and serene, her starved, enamelled,
hard flesh torn, her dress the blue of late dusk,
the heaven behind her a work of flat blinding gold.

The composer Karlheinz Stockhausenclaimed he was born on Sirius. You remember him:the genius who said the crashing of planesinto the World Trade Center was the greatest concert ever held,although he later conceded the audience had not been given the optionto not attendand that somewhat diminished its perfection.I heard Stockhausen interviewed at Davies Symphony Hallbefore the orchestra played one of   his worksthat sounded to me like the voices of   the parentsin A Charlie Brown Christmas if they’d been arguing about real estate.No, I was not impressed by Karlheinz.His daughter Christel was a flautist in the orchestra,and she joined him for the interviewand said her father would take her and her brother out on the lawnof their summer house outside Cologne(this was years before he was on the cover of   Sgt. Pepper)and teach them to read each constellationas notes on a stave and to singthe words of their favorite nursery rhymes to the stars’melody: “The dog ran away in the snow” and“Go get the sleigh in the cellar.” It was a gamebut it was hard: work and play at once.Their father explained to them,“God does not write catchy tunes.”You could tell she meant it to be a charming story,but the audience sat in silence.Suffer the little children.

                ","
We have been cruising, half a block
at a time, my wife, my two children,
all morning, and I have been pointing out
unhurriedly and with some feeling
places of consequence, sacred places,
backyards, lush fields, garages, alleyways.
“There,” I say, “by this big cottonwood,
That’s where I dropped the fly ball, 1959.”
“And in 1961,” I say, “at this very corner,
Barry Sapolsky tripped me up with his gym bag.”
My son has fallen asleep, my daughter
has been nodding “yes” indiscriminately
for the last half hour, and my wife
has the frozen, wide-eyed look of the undead.
“Maybe lunch,” I say, though I’m making now
my fourth approach to Curtin Jr. High School,
yellow-bricked, large-windowed, gothic,
where Frank Marone preyed on our terror once
and Janice Lehman walked in beauty.
“Salute, everyone,” I say, “salute,”
bringing my hand up to my brow as we pass
the gilded entrance, “This is where things
of importance happened,” and I am pulling out
from under the car seat a photo album
of old school pictures, “Page 8,” I say,
“Fred Decker, John Carlson by the bike rack,
Mr. Burkett … ,” and driving on, following
the invisible map before my eyes.
Now we are drifting toward my boyhood house
and I am showing my wife trellised porches,
bike routes, more than she’d care to see;
“Why this longing?” she says, “What about now,
the kids, our lives together, lunch, me?”
I give her a kiss and turn right on Cherry
and there in front of our eyes, barely changed,
is the house where all my memories converge.
“Look at the windows of my room,” I say,
“see, there, the shadowy figure moving behind them?”
And before anyone can hope to answer,
I have grabbed my camera, I am snapping
pictures through the windshield, bricks,
dormers, railings, fences, streets, all
are falling thrall to my aim.
“We could be happy here,” I say, putting
another roll of film in and beginning
to nose my car toward Bill Corson’s house.
“Really, Daddy,” my daughter says; “No chance,”
my wife tacks on, but all I’m hearing
is the crack of bats in the neighborhood lot
and Danny’s pearl-handled cap gun going off
and the drone of bees around honeysuckle
and Dewey Waugh’s gravelly voice
urging on his mower, and the sound
of wind in the cottonwoods is like water,
I am coasting, there is time for everything.

                ","
The youngest living thing in L. A. was my baby.
The oldest living thing was the wind.
 
The wind grew well in that city in the desert.
As did my garden of well-tended cement.
As did my baby, whom I held like a heavy statuette.
 
 
I named him Mill at his birth  . . .  As the wheel goeth by drift of water . . .
 
 
And he grew and the wind blew and we lived in that desert and . . . no rain. No rain, no river. No sound of water. But for—
 
The fountain water.
 
The official fountain. Which flowed. Every day. Every day the baby slept. The baby breathed. The fountain flowed. It flowed imperceptibly. As if its water were fast asleep.
 
 
We stood on the fountain’s shore: woman + newborn.
We made one totem.
I named the baby Easter Island.
 
 
We played I Spy.
 
I saw: coins at the fountain’s bottom. Eyes. Copper cataracts, winking through the water at us.
 
 
I held the baby close. I held the baby stiffly. I brought the baby to see nobody.
 
 
I saw: statues in the fountain’s water. Statues in tall grasses on the shore of a sea. I turned to tell somebody. The city had disappeared into complete silence. There was only: the baby.
 
 
We were watching the water wrinkle in the wind.
In the distance, maids were ironing.
 
 
Overhead: jets drew ciphers in the blue with their chalk.
 The drift of the maker is dark.  Beware that by the drifts thou perish not. 
The statues, the statues in the strange fountain were looking at us. They were weeping and turning, turning and weeping.
 
They might have seen the city shimmering in the sun and wind, and known . . . It was a city with no one in it. If a door somewhere on the street opened, it would always be . . . no one.
 
It would be a bad draft that had blossomed.
 
 
I longed for meadows white with drifts of snow. I named the baby Drift.
 
In the winter I had planned to bring him north. To a barn’s eaves, to hear icicles drip. To prepare him to grow up in the path of the next great glacial drift.
 
 
City whose sky was white jet streaks.
 
Whose houses were apparitions of asbestos flakes.
 
Whose homeless sipped wind from tins.
 
 
Whose only water was the strange fountain.
 
 Angel, my angel, my sweetheart, wake up. See the foam on the wave, see the tornado, the hurricane.  
We stood on the fountain’s shore. The wind blew particulates of rug powder, of lemon-scented floor polish. The maids of the city were cleaning so completely.
 
And mutely.
 
There may have been other names I gave the baby.Zeno sweet Zeno Little fellow little fellow Vertigo  
I said to the baby, We will stand here until there is snow on the mountain. 
I may have meant to say fountain. 
We peered all day into the strange fountain.  
I said to myself, That is just your face stiffening around your cheeks. That is just grass growing at your feet.  
I held the baby all the time, and he never ever cried.

—for Frank Espada



The beer company
did not hire Blacks or Puerto Ricans,
so my father joined the picket line
at the Schaefer Beer Pavilion, New York World’s Fair,   
amid the crowds glaring with canine hostility.   
But the cops brandished nightsticks
and handcuffs to protect the beer,
and my father disappeared.
In 1964, I had never tasted beer,
and no one told me about the picket signs   
torn in two by the cops of brewery.
I knew what dead was: dead was a cat   
overrun with parasites and dumped   
in the hallway incinerator.
I knew my father was dead.
I went mute and filmy-eyed, the slow boy   
who did not hear the question in school.   
I sat studying his framed photograph   
like a mirror, my darker face.
Days later, he appeared in the doorway   
grinning with his gilded tooth.
Not dead, though I would come to learn   
that sometimes Puerto Ricans die   
in jail, with bruises no one can explain   
swelling their eyes shut.
I would learn too that “boycott”
is not a boy’s haircut,
that I could sketch a picket line   
on the blank side of a leaflet.
That day my father returned
from the netherworld
easily as riding the elevator to apartment 14-F,   
and the brewery cops could only watch   
in drunken disappointment.
I searched my father’s hands
for a sign of the miracle.

Time has no mercy. It’s there. It stays still or it moves.
And you’re there with it. Staying still or moving with it.
I think it moves. And we move with it. And keep moving.
Eleven years old and soon to be in fifth grade. That’s time.
Boys’ time. Who knows what time it is but them. Eternally.
No one knows time better than they. Always and forever.
Our family. Mama, me, Angie, Gilbert, Earl, Louise.
Kids. Daddy working in Skull Valley for the AT&SF RY.
Mama just packed us up in New Mexico and moved us.
Suddenly. A surprise. To me anyway. To join Daddy.
Who was away most of the time. Arizona. California.
Sometimes Colorado. Sometimes Texas. Always away.
Railroad work, labor, heavy machinery. Rails and sun.
Trains always moving. I remember the war. The 1940s.
Soldiers. Tanks. Cannons with huge guns and wheels.
Time does have mercy. But it doesn’t enumerate or wait.
It moves. And we move with it. Though for boys, maybe?
I wanted to wait. So things could happen more gently.
A boy misses his father. A boy watches younger sisters.
And younger brothers. All growing. And he’s growing.
And he misses the times his mother is happy, laughing.
Who knows time as well as boys and their young worries?
I was a boy growing within a family, community. And dreams.
And girls. Girl teenagers. I adored them, their pretty ways.
In the fourth grade at McCartys. Made a bookshelf in shop.
Proudly. Sanded. Varnished. Shiny. For my Mama.
With love. I wanted to be a good carpenter like my Dad.
Dad drank though. Dark moods. Dark scary times. Danger.
And words hurtful, abrasive, accusing. Anger, pain, scorn.
A boy wonders. About time. About forever. When it ends.
I loved my Dad. Wonderful. Skilled man. Artist, singer.
Precious and assuring. Yet. Yet. Unpredictable moments.
You can never tell about time either. Like that, it is. It is.
We farmed. Corn, melons, chili, beets, carrots, cilantro.
Onions. Even potatoes in little mounds but they died.
Corn fields at night. Irrigating. June nights. I loved forever.
My grandpa I loved very much. Time was soothing then.
We didn’t really need time when days and nights were safe.
And with him they were. A healer and respected kiva elder.
Herded his sheep. Along with my uncle Estevan. And Roy.
Roy was a strange one. Chinese manner. So people said.
From Chinatown in California. He had a gentle soft smile.
And a storyteller he was. Yes. About his horse. Lightning.
Fast and nimble and quick. Lightning, his horse. He’d ride.
Yes, ride to see his girl to call her outside. Estella! Estella!
Stories. I’d listen. The boy I was. Seeing my uncle riding.
Riding his fast and nimble horse. I’d listen and he’d smile.
Memory and time. It doesn’t count all the time. Listening.
And because mothers are always loving. Alert. Ever caring.
Mama decided we must go to Skull Valley where Dad was.
Up to Grants, the depot there, we got on the westbound train.
Sacks and boxes, a trunk, suitcase or two. Clothes, things.
What did we have? I don’t remember. Not much though.
We never had much. Poor. And lonely for Dad always away.
I wonder. I wonder. Too often that’s been the Indian story.
Father gone. Mother and kids left behind. Is it like that?
Yes, too much. Dad didn’t like working for the hard railroad.
He’d complain and rant about the crude and mean whites.
The slave rules. The company. Trains powerful, unending.
Time I thought was in the trains. Fast, loud, dangerous.
I was afraid of the powerful trains. Like I said I’d see them.
Soldiers, army troop trains, going east and going west.
Unending. I wondered where they were all going. Where?
Lightning and thunder trapped in the train power and steel.
Yet I yearned for blue song. Hollow and lonely long tone.
Coming round the bend, and something beyond the horizon.
Far away maybe. Travel. Some other dream. Youth. Yes.
I liked songs. Music I heard on the radio. Hank Williams.
And stories that rang through the air. Talk and listening.
It was the first time ever we were leaving the reservation.
Only one world till then it seemed. Acoma community. Ours.
On the edge of another world though, something strange.
And fearful too. The dark moments. Like when Daddy drank.
When there was fire from another world. An unknown.
Yet fascinating somehow, oddly, something on the far horizon.
I didn’t remember riding the train before. Ever! Until then.
Like riding thunder. The horse, Lightning, Roy talked about.
Riding off somewhere into the dark night. Fast, fast. Fast.
Riding toward night. We watched the land speeding away.
Far across the land, along the edge of it was a highway.
With cars and trucks. Moving, moving. Only slower.
Time speeds, like you speed. Only not an awareness.
Or any way to tell what is taking place. When young.
And you’re trying to furnish your own answers, solutions.
To mysteries you’re anxious about. When all’s uncertain.
Youth is not the time when time is apparent. Too slow.
Or too fast. And you don’t really have clear reasons. Yet.
At Ashfork we got off the train onto the depot platform.
I sensed being lost. Lost mother and lost children. Dusk.
Where was this world? Where did home go? Children?
Lost at the edge of a strange world with a gray green depot.
Large letters painted. Little sister is hungry. She whimpers.
Mama says, “Hold my hand.” We walk, up street, walk, walk.
It could be Indians. A family, mother and children. Lost?
Where are they going? Up the street I think. Looking.
For something to eat. My mother held only a little money.
Hamburgers we split. Water and water. Self-conscious.
Moment is time. I looked out and saw a train passing.
Our train! I thought it was our train. But it wasn’t, just fear!
Wait. Then a train down Chino Valley. Long-distance night.
Stars vanished in too much night. Long day into night.
Where does time go? Does it go nowhere but into night?
Then at the sudden edge. The horizon. A vast bowl of light.
And only at the far end, trees. And still far ahead of us.
The train engine light. Always a light showing the way.
My brother and I excited. A deer stunned by train light.
Stilled. Stark. A cut stone. The dazzling moment held us.
Youth and time. Nothing like it. Thrilled. Never until then.
Years later I tried to tell about that moment to a love.
But love is time too. So. Can’t do anything but live time.
The horizon and beyond. Full of stars. Even unseen.
Always belief is firmer than faith. With and without dreams.
We arrived in Skull Valley early in the morning. Three-thirty?
Where were we? On the other side of the moon from Acoma.
A mother and her children and assorted bags and boxes.
Dreams. Time. Horizon. Farther from home than belief.
It felt like that. Within moment when you can’t turn away.
A train depot on the other side of the moon. Deserted.
After the train pulled away. Only the rails and starshine.
What’s a boy say to his mother? Earlier than anything.
A man whose picture I’d seen. White man. With a cap.
With a visor. Sitting at a tall wooden desk with shelves.
And a metal puzzle thing making clicking-clacking noises.
Who spoke with Mama. Who smiled. Who wondered at us.
An Indian woman with Indian children. Who were strangers.
Like we just came from the planet Acoma. The other side.
Of day. Of the present early morning night in that moment.
The telegrapher with the visor said. I think. I think he did.
He knew my father. Knew where he lived. Two miles away.
So we took a road. Early, early morning night trek. Time.
Shimmers in an odd amazing way. Within what might be.
A boy and a story. The dawn coming. Horizon ever so near.
When we knocked on his railroad worker housing door.
Daddy was shocked. In his underwear. Shadows upon.
And the background of his and Mama’s and our history.
We come to discover each other. All failures and gains.
Counting and mattering, no matter the time or sequence.
We laugh and hug and cry. Daddy. Daddy. We’re here.
Once again together. Family, history, travel, time, love.
To say what time is, even fifty years in the past to now.
In this moment, Skull Valley is just as real as it ever was.
Memory we cross and cross again. Treks, trauma, and on.
We do know what time is. It is loss and gain. A lingering.
Within discovery we come to ourselves. Finding. Destiny.
Moments recalled like friends. It was that way or another.
We’re fairly certain either way. Stories. They are with us.
Time doesn’t forsake. It doesn’t soothe or decrease. Never.
Skull Valley. A time for a boy. History engulfed beyond.
When I went back. Recently. I ate with friends at the cafe.
By the railroad track. I was fascinated by photographs.
Of the mountain lions in the mountains nearby. Ever there.
No matter what. And the stories of bones. Tall tales or truths.
They’re told. Apaches, it’s said. Wagon trains. Lies or no.
Our history is more than here. We know more than realize.
We realize what we don’t know. Or want to know. Truths.
Stalk us, just like they found. A boy. More than fifty years ago.
He discovered a world beyond Acoma. A world apart.
And a world together as time, memory, as story. As his own.
We seek and are found. Secure. Actual. Safe. And serene.
Last summer near Prescott that boy fifty vast years later.
Found carved images on stone walls that fit his hands.
Carved in time. Eternal as stone. Past and present. Ever.
                                                                Let’s say it is ever an ongoing story.

Near the camp was a river

that will one day wake us in vain
 
I had just turned seven
while he was sitting in the shade
ironing his clothes
the blue jacket sagging over his shoulders
 
I paid no attention to the road
or the three steps
and didn't notice the carpet
 
I don't remember who was it that said
to me or to another
""When you grow up poetry will become your house""

always distances those folks

on shoulders topped
with five flowers
 
Which flowers are speech
which flowers are silence?

in our house in Karameh,
 
whether my mother
who gave birth to me on the shelf
was folding our clothes behind our father's back
so he could sleep
 
The watchdogs used to cry from the heat,
and poetry, Husseini of Jerusalem,
and Khidr the mystic were all in our house
as was my uncle who came from a pond
within Hebron's walls
 
Twenty years would pass before a photo could tell us

On the corrugated roof is a horse treading,
A horse with wide wings and heavy hoofs. The lizard
Is splayed head down on the wall, pulsing. They do not
Bother to lift their binoculars to the shimmering distance.
From this dead center the desert spirals away,
Traveling outward and inward, pulsing. Summoned
From half across the world, from snow and rock,
From chaos, they arrived a moment ago, they thought,
In perfect fortuity. There is a presence emerging here in
Sun dance and clicking metal, where the lizard blinks
With eyes whetted for extinction; then swirling
Outward again, outward and upward through the sky's
White-hot funnel. Again and again among the dry
Wailing voices of displaced Yankee ghosts

This one happens in morning
as a nearby crow wakes me,
calling God, God, look at this :
I am on the steps of a church,
wrapped in Monday's Korea Times
telling of the drought in Pusan.
You can live by the water
and still die of thirst, and I,
there on the cold brick steps,
am dying. But dying
means the presence of breath.
This one happens on Hangul Day,
Independence Day in Seoul,
where girls in purple satin
hanboks parade through
downtown streets. In this dream
I make eye contact with
every single one of them.
Another boy, a few years
older than I, rides
a tricycle in the parade,
trailing the girls.
He sees me. He winks,
as if he knows how
everything will end.
2.
This one happens in the evening
just as daylight surrenders to the moon,
and the flute of dusk arrives.
It is cool.
I am wrapped in a sky blue blanket,
so whoever finds me thinks kindly
of whoever left me.
The one who finds me is a nun.
She opens the door, looking
beyond me
into the tired night,
then looks down.
She gasps softly.
She says, ahneyong, you sweet
beautiful child. She bends
down like an angel
and takes me
into her arms.
3.
This one happens in the cruelest moment
of the day, as heat curls flowers
into dirt. A man, drunk
with despair, screams at the sun.
His sorrow is a collage of
moths and ants, crawling
from his face to his chest.
I watch from the steps.
It is the year of the dog
and I am a part of it :
unable to speak
but an expert at listening :
to the old man from Laos who sits
on the steps two buildings down :
he is telling another man
how Hmong children become human
on the third day of life,
after the soul calling ceremony
and the burning of animal flesh.
He smokes from a pipe
and closes his eyes as he inhales.
I can hear all of this.
I can hear a woman rustling inside the church.
She is a dancer, so she speaks with her hands.
I hear her rise, sweetly
from her knees to her feet.
This means she believes
in dreams. I hear her
slide her hand, sweetly
along her hair. This means
she believes in the sun.
I hear her move towards me
and place her open palm on the door.
This means she welcomes me.
This means she believes
in the miracle of possibility.

Bill Russell & Wilt Chamberlain, one on one
the final game of the 1969 NBA championship,
two hard men snapped elbowing & snatching at a basketball
as if it were a moment one of them might stay inside
forever. I was with
my father the night that game played
on a fuzzy color television, in a jammed Fall River bar.
Seagram & beer chasers for hoarse ex-jocks,
smoke rifting the air. A drunk called him “Tiger”
and asked about the year he’d made all-state guard—
point man, ball-hawk, pacer. Something he rarely spoke
of, & almost always with a gruff mix of impatience
and shyness. Each year,
days painting suburban tract houses & fighting
with contractors followed by
night shifts at the fire station
followed by his kids swarming at breakfast
and my mother trying to stay out of his way,
each of the many stone-hard moments between 1941 & 1969—
they made up a city of granite mills
by a slate & blue river. That town was my father’s
life, & still is. If he felt cheated by it,
by its fate for him,
to bear that disappointment, he kept it secret.
That
night, when he stared deep into a drunk’s memory,
he frowned. He said nothing. He twisted on the stool,
and ordered this guy a beer.
Whatever my father & I have in common
is mostly silence. And anger that keeps twisting
back on itself, though not before it ruins,
often, even something simple
as a walk in the dunes at a warm beach.
But what we share too is a love so awkward
that it explains, with unreasoning perfection,
why we still can’t speak
easily to each other, about the past or anything else,
and why I wake this far from the place where I grew up,
while the wall above me claims now
nothing has changed & all is different.

Hand-pressed the greengage wine. Nothing is cost-effective here. The peas, the beets, the lettuces hand sown, are raised to stand apart. The electric fence ticks like the slow heart of something we fed and bedded for a year, then killed with kindness’s one bullet and paid Jake Mott to do the butchering. In winter we lure the birds with suet, thaw lungs and kidneys for the cat. Darlings, it’s all a circle from the ring of wire that keeps the raccoons from the corn to the gouged pine table that we lounge around, distressed before any of you was born. Benign and dozy from our gluttonies, the candles down to stubs, defenses down, love leaking out unguarded the way juice dribbles from the fence when grounded by grass stalks or a forgotten hoe, how eloquent, how beautiful you seem!

I would figure out all the right answers
first, then gently mark a few of them wrong.
If a quiz had ten problems, I'd cancel
out one. When it had twenty, I'd bite my tongue
then leave at least two questions blank: _____ _____.
A B was good, but an A was too good.
They'd kick your ass, call your big sisterslow, then stare over your desk, as if you'd

Because we did not have threads
of turquoise, silver, and gold,
we could not sew a sun nor sky.
And our hands became balls of fire.
And our arms spread open like wings.
Because we had no chalk or pastels,
no toad, forest, or morning-grass slats
of paper, we had no colour
for creatures. So we squatted
and sprang, squatted and sprang.

Now in thy dazzling half-oped eye, Thy curled nose and lip awry, Uphoisted arms and noddling head, And little chin with crystal spread, Poor helpless thing! what do I see, That I should sing of thee? From thy poor tongue no accents come, Which can but rub thy toothless gum: Small understanding boasts thy face, Thy shapeless limbs nor step nor grace: A few short words thy feats may tell, And yet I love thee well. When wakes the sudden bitter shriek, And redder swells thy little cheek When rattled keys thy woes beguile, And through thine eyelids gleams the smile, Still for thy weakly self is spent Thy little silly plaint. But when thy friends are in distress. Thou’lt laugh and chuckle n’ertheless, Nor with kind sympathy be smitten, Though all are sad but thee and kitten; Yet puny varlet that thou art, Thou twitchest at the heart. Thy smooth round cheek so soft and warm; Thy pinky hand and dimpled arm; Thy silken locks that scantly peep, With gold tipped ends, where circle deep, Around thy neck in harmless grace, So soft and sleekly hold their place, Might harder hearts with kindness fill, And gain our right goodwill. Each passing clown bestows his blessing, Thy mouth is worn with old wives’ kissing; E’en lighter looks the gloomy eye Of surly sense when thou art by; And yet, I think, whoe’er they be, They love thee not like me. Perhaps when time shall add a few Short years to thee, thou’lt love me too; And after that, through life’s long way, Become my sure and cheering stay; Wilt care for me and be my hold, When I am weak and old. Thou’lt listen to my lengthened tale, And pity me when I am frail — But see, the sweepy spinning fly Upon the window takes thine eye. Go to thy little senseless play; Thou dost not heed my lay.

How hard it is to sleep
in the middle of a life.
— Audre Lorde



We wake in the middle of a life,                    hungry.
We smear durian            along our mouths, sing soft
death a lullaby. Carcass breath, eros of  licked fingers
and the finest perfume. What is love if  not         rot?
We wear the fruit’s hull as a spiked crown, grinning
in green armor.   Death to the grub, fat in his milky
shuffle! Death to the lawlessness       of dirt! Death
to mud and its false chocolate!   To the bloated sun
we want to slice open and yolk                      all over
the village. We want a sun-drenched           slug feast,
an omelet loosening its folds like hot Jell-O. We want
the marbled fat of steak and all        its swirling pink
galaxies. We want the drool, the gnash, the pluck of
each corn kernel, raw and summer                   swell.
Tears welling up                     oil. Order up! Pickled
cucumbers piled like logs for a fire, like fat limbs we
pepper and succulent                in. Order up: shrimp
chips curling in a porcelain bowl like subway seats.
Grapes peeled from bitter bark — almost translucent,
like eyes we would rather see. Little girl, what do you
leave, leaven              in your sight? Death to the open
eyes of  the dying. Here,           there are so many open
eyes we can’t close each one.          No, we did not say
the steamed eye of a fish. No eyelids fluttering like
no butterfly wings. No purple yam lips. We said eyes.
Still and resolute as a heartbreaker.         Does this break
your heart?                                      Look, we don’t want
to be rude, but seconds, please. Want: globes of oranges
swallowed whole like a basketball or Mars or whatever
planet is the most delicious.                   Slather Saturn!
Ferment Mercury! Lap up its film of dust, yuk sung!
Seconds, thirds, fourths! Meat wool! A bouquet of
chicken feet! A garden of                   melons, monstrous
in their bulge!               Prune back nothing. We purr
in this garden. We comb through berries and come out
so blue. Little girl,                            lasso tofu, the rope
slicing its belly clean. Deep fry a cloud so it tastes like
bitter gourd or your father leaving — the exhaust of
his car, charred. Serenade a snake and slither its tongue
into yours and                           bite. Love! What is love
if  not knotted in garlic? Child, we move through graves
like eels, delicious         with our heads first, our mouths
agape. Our teeth:         little needles to stitch a factory of
everything made in China.      You ask: Are you hungry?
Hunger eats through the air like ozone. You ask: What
does it mean to be rootless? Roots are good to use as
toothpicks. You: How can you wake in the middle of
a life? We shut and open our eyes like the sun shining
on tossed pennies in a forgotten well. Bald copper,
blood. Yu choy bolts                  into roses down here.
While you were sleeping, we woke to the old leaves
of  your backyard shed and ate that and one of your
lost flip-flops too. In a future life, we saw rats overtake
a supermarket with so much milk, we turned opaque.
We wake to something boiling. We wake to wash dirt
from lettuce, to blossom into your face. Aphids along
the lashes. Little girl, don’t forget              to take care
of  the chickens, squawking in their mess and stench.
Did our mouths buckle                                at the sight
of  you devouring slice                after slice of  pizza and
the greasy box too? Does this frontier swoon for you?
It’s time to wake up. Wake the tapeworm who loves
his home. Wake the ants,                  let them do-si-do
a spoonful of  peanut butter. Tell us, little girl, are you
hungry, awake,                               astonished enough?

“Earth is the birth of the blues,” sang Yellow Bertha,   
as she chopped cotton beside Mama Rose.   
It was as hot as any other summer day,   
when she decided to run away.
Folks say she made a fortune
running a whorehouse in New Orleans,
but others say she’s buried somewhere out west,   
her grave unmarked,
though you can find it in the dark
by the scent of jasmine and mint,
but I’m getting ahead of myself.
If it wasn’t for hell,
we’d all be tapdancing with the devil
Mama Rose used to say,
but as it is, we just stand and watch,
while someone else burns up before salvation.   
“People desire damnation, Bertha,” she said,   
unwrapping the rag from her head
to let the sweat flow down the corn rows,   
plaited as tightly as the night coming down   
on the high and mighty on judgment day.   
They say she knew what was coming,   
because she threw some bones that morning.
She bent down to pick up her rag which had fallen   
and when she straightened up, her yellow gal   
had gone down the road.
“Go then,” she called out, “I didn’t want you no how.”
Then she started talking to herself
about how Old White John caught her milking cows.   
“He wrestled me to the ground and did his nastiness.”   
He said, “your daddy was a slave and his daddy   
and I’m claiming back what’s mine.”
It was July. I remember fireworks going off outside.   
When Bertha come, so white
she liked to scared me to death,
I let her suckle my breast
and I said, “All right, little baby,
maybe I’ll love you. Maybe.”
Mama Rose said she did her best,
but it’s hard to raise a gal like that
with everybody thinking she’s giving them the high hat,   
because she’s so light and got those green eyes   
that look right through you. She frightens people.   
Even men, who’re usually wanting to saddle up   
and ride that kind of mare, can’t abide her.
They’re afraid if they try her, they’ll never be the same.   
The only ones willing are white.
They’re watching her day and night,
but they know John swore to kill any man
who touched her,
because lo and behold, he owns up to her.
He’s proud of her. Nobody can believe it.
He’s even at her baptism.
He buys her cheap dresses and candy at the store.   
He hands it to her out the door,
because she can’t go in.
He won’t, he won’t stop looking at her
like it’s some kind of miracle she was born
looking so much like him and his people.
It’s a warning, or something.
“It’s evil turning back on itself,” said the preacher   
the Sunday cut clean through by the truth,
by the living proof, as Old John stood up in church   
and testified to the power of God,
who spoke to him that morning,
telling him he was a sinner.
He died that winter. Horrible suffering, they say.   
He had a stroke on the way to town.
His car ran off the road and he drowned.
They say Bertha found him.
They say she ran all the way to town for the doctor,   
who told her, “I am not a colored doctor,”
so she went and got the sheriff.
He listened for a while, then he locked her in a cell.   
He said he knew she was guilty of something.   
Well, after a while, Rose went down there
and I swear she nearly had a fit.
“Get my daughter out here,” she said.
“How can you lock up your own brother’s child?”   
The sheriff knew it was true, so finally he said,   
“You take her and don’t ever cross my path again.”   
When Bertha passed him on the way out,
he tripped her with his foot.
When she got off the floor, she said,
“Every dog has its day.”
From that time to this is a straight line,   
pointing at a girl,
who doesn’t even have shoes anymore,   
as she runs down the road,
throwing off her ragged clothes, as she goes,
until she’s as naked as the day she was born.   
When she comes to washing hanging on the line,   
she grabs a fine dress and keeps on running.   
She’s crying and laughing at the same time.
Along comes a truck that says J. GOODY on the side.   
The man driving stops to give her a ride.
He swings the door open on the passenger side,   
but Bertha says, “Move over, I’ll drive.”
When she asks him why he stopped,
he says, “I know white trash, when I see it.
You’re just like me, but you're a girl. You’re pretty.   
You can free yourself. All you have to do
is show a little leg and some titty in the big city.”   
He gave her fifty cents and a wink
and she started thinking she might as well turn white.   
She got a job waiting table in a dance hall.   
One night, the boss heard her
singing along with the band.
He said, “Why don’t you go up on stage,”
and she said, “I play piano too.”
He said, “Howdy do.”
From then on, she made everybody pay
one way, or another.
She got hard. She took lovers—
fathers, sons, and husbands.
It didn't matter,
but once in a while, she heard her mother’s voice,   
saying, “You made the wrong choice,”
and she felt the blues
and she let loose with a shout.
“Lordy,” said the boss, “you sound colored.”   
More and more people came to hear her sing,
but they kind of feared her too.
They said, she was too white to sing the blues like that.   
It wasn’t right.
One night, she got to talking with the boss.
He walked round and round the office, shaking his head,   
saying how much he’d lose,
if she stopped singing the blues.
“How often can you find a treasure like mine,” he said,   
laying his hand on her shoulder,
then he said, “If I weren’t so old,”
and his voice dropped off to a whisper,
then he said, “I got the answer now, sweet Roberta.   
Go on down to the dressing room and wait.”   
It didn't take long.
He came in and set a jar on the table.   
“What do I do with this?” Asked Bertha.   
He said, “you’re going to pass for colored.”   
Suddenly, she was wearing blackface.   
Suddenly, she was safe on the other side   
of the door she slammed on the past
and it was standing open at last.
She could come and go as she pleased   
and no one saw her enter, or leave.
She was free, she was freed,
but she didn’t feel it
and she needed it to be real.
She went on, though. She flowed like a river,   
carrying the body of a man,
who had himself a nigger, because he could.   
She lived. She got old.
She almost froze one cold spell
and she got up from her sickbed
and told her daughter
she got during the change of life
it was time to go.
She sewed a note to her ragged coat.
It said, “This is the granddaughter of Mama Rose.”
She put fifty cents in her hand
and went to stand with her at the bus stop.   
She would not return, but her child
had earned the right to go home.
When I got off the bus,
a hush fell over the people waiting there.   
I was as white as my mother,
but my eyes were gray, not green.
I had hair down to my waist and braids so thick   
they weighed me down.
Mother said, my father was a white musician   
from another town,
who found out her secret
and left her and me to keep it.
Mama Rose knew me, though, blind as she was.   
“What color are you, gal?” She asked
and I told her, “I’m as black as last night.”
That's how I passed, without asking permission.

So you see why it could not have been a more humble moment.
If there was any outward sign of regalia
It might have been the twilight crowning of the day, just then,
A perfect moment of dusk, but changing, as a wave does
Even as you admire it. Because the southbound stop
Mirrors the one northbound where we so often find ourselves
At the beginning, southbound’s return holds the memory
Of northbound’s setting-out, and the grassy median between
With its undisturbed trees defines an elusive strip of the present
Where no one lives. After twenty-eight years of the trip,
It’s like two beakers of colored water — one green, one blue — 
Have poured themselves back and forth, because
On one side we are tinted by remembering the other.
But this aspect of the journey, at least, we know we will repeat.
As dusk cohered that moment — aquas, pinks, violets — 
Just at that moment as I was returning to the car
A woman came the other way, her two young daughters
Holding her hands, and the gloaming sparkled around them
So that I froze, as they were backlit, starry,
They were the southbound reminder of who I had been beginning
The trip. She didn’t look like me, but what I did recognize
Was her clarity of purpose, in what Sharon Olds calledthe days of great usefulness, making life as nice
As she could for them, always writing the best story,
And also, beneath her skin, living with delight as quiet
As the shoots anchoring grass beneath the earth.
I walked back to my car. My husband sat in the driver’s seat,
Our weekend’s luggage thrown in back.Tell me we really had those girls, I said,and that they held my hands like that. When I got home
I pictured her helping them each into bed — I knew it was
Later than she had hoped — then reading
Each section of the paper’s terrible news, finally alone.

The children are back, the children are back— They’ve come to take refuge, exhale and unpack; The marriage has faltered, the job has gone bad, Come open the door for them, Mother and Dad.The city apartment is leaky and cold, The landlord lascivious, greedy and old— The mattress is lumpy, the oven’s encrusted, The freezer, the fan, and the toilet have rusted.The company caved, the boss went broke, The job and the love affair, all up in smoke. The anguish of loneliness comes as a shock— O heart in the doldrums, O heart in hock.And so they return with their piles of possessions, Their terrified cats and their mournful expressions, Reclaiming the bedrooms they had in their teens, Clean towels, warm comforter, glass figurines.Downstairs in the kitchen the father and mother Don’t say a word, but they look at each other As down from the hill comes Jill, comes Jack. The children are back. The children are back.

                ","
The summer of nineteen eighteen   
I read The Jungle and TheResearch Magnificent. That fall   
My father died and my aunt   
Took me to Chicago to live.   
The first thing I did was to take   
A streetcar to the stockyards.   
In the winter afternoon,   
Gritty and fetid, I walked
Through the filthy snow, through the   
Squalid streets, looking shyly   
Into the people’s faces,
Those who were home in the daytime.   
Debauched and exhausted faces,   
Starved and looted brains, faces   
Like the faces in the senile   
And insane wards of charity   
Hospitals. Predatory
Faces of little children.
Then as the soiled twilight darkened,   
Under the green gas lamps, and the   
Sputtering purple arc lamps,   
The faces of the men coming
Home from work, some still alive with   
The last pulse of hope or courage,   
Some sly and bitter, some smart and   
Silly, most of them already   
Broken and empty, no life,   
Only blinding tiredness, worse   
Than any tired animal.   
The sour smells of a thousand   
Suppers of fried potatoes and   
Fried cabbage bled into the street.   
I was giddy and sick, and out   
Of my misery I felt rising   
A terrible anger and out
Of the anger, an absolute vow.   
Today the evil is clean
And prosperous, but it is   
Everywhere, you don’t have to   
Take a streetcar to find it,
And it is the same evil.
And the misery, and the
Anger, and the vow are the same.

the jewelry, in the gray house

What woke to war in me those years
When my daughter had first grown into
A solid self-centered self? I’d watch her
Sit at the table—well, not quite sit,
More like stand on one leg while
The other knee hovered just over the chair.
She wouldn't lower herself, as if
There might be a fire, or a great black
Blizzard of waves let loose in the kitchen,
And she'd need to make her escape. No,
She'd trust no one but herself, her own
New lean always jittering legs to carry her—
Where exactly? Where would a child go?
To there. There alone. She'd rest one elbow
On the table—the opposite one to the bent leg
Skimming the solid expensive tasteful chair.
And even though we were together, her eyes
Would go half-dome, shades dropped
Like a screen at some cinema the old aren't
Let into. I thought I'd have more time! I thought
My body would have taken longer going
About the inevitable feat of repelling her,
But now, I could see even in what food
She left untouched, food I'd bought and made
And all but ferried to her lips, I could see
How it smacked of all that had grown slack
And loose in me. Her other arm
Would wave the fork around just above
The surface of the plate, casting about
For the least possible morsel, the tiniest
Grain of unseasoned rice. She'd dip
Into the food like one of those shoddy
Metal claws poised over a valley of rubber
Bouncing balls, the kind that lifts nothing
Or next to nothing and drops it in the chute.
The narrow untouched hips. The shoulders
Still so naïve as to stand squared, erect,
Impervious facing the window open
Onto the darkening dusk.

I put my thumbs and forefingers
to my eye and frame her. I am reminded
of those Chinese boxes made of red paper,
inside one is another holding another,
until at the center sits the tiniest mockery
and celebration of the cell itself.
She looks haggard but happy here, five flights
up, bending over a fat leaf as if admiring herself
in the waxy surface. Then she opens up
the jewel-case of her voice,
and I remember how once my sister asked
my mother which one of us sang better.

seventeen to seventy-five and said we sounded
the same. Good or bad, who knows.

First the violins had to be snug again
inside their black cases
for who knew how many more months or years or lifetimes;   
then he had to pretend to have forgotten
why I was sitting there wide-eyed across from him
long after my sister and brother had gone off with friends.   
Every time, as if only an afterthought,
He’d sneak into his pocket and ease the switchblade   
onto the bare table between us,
its thumb-button jutting from the pearl-and-silver plating   
like the eye of some sleek prehistoric fish.
I must have known it wouldn’t come to life   
and slither toward me by itself,
but when he’d finally nod to me to take it
its touch was still warm with his body heat   
and I could feel the blade inside aching
to flash open with the terrible click
that sounds now like just a tsk of disappointment,   
it has become so sweet and quiet.

The seams of their work clothes, weary to hysteria
As they hunched in their booth next to the buffet
Under heat lamps reflecting incarnadine
Off pastas and vegetable slag. Then the joke
Ignited, they quivered on the launch pad,
Laughter closed around them, they couldn’t
Breathe, it was as if they were staring out
From a space capsule porthole and were asking
The void an imponderable riddle
While orbiting so high up in space
That the earth was less than the least hint
Of light piercing the smoke-filled, cloudless night.
(What was the joke about? Nobody knew.)
And then they stopped laughing and stared into their plates,
Ash smearing down their faces as they chewed.
    4 / spell spoken by suppliant to helios for knowledge
                         from the Greek Magical Papyri
Under my tongue is the mud of the Nile,
I wear the baboon hide of sacred Keph.
Dressed in the god’s power, I am the god,
I am Thouth, discoverer of healing drugs,
Founder of letters. As god calls on god
I summon you to come to me, you
Under the earth; arouse yourself for me,
Great daimon, you the subterranean,
You of the primordial abyss.
Unless you tell me what I want to know,
What is in the minds of everyone, Egyptians,
Greeks, Syrians, Ethiopians, of every race
And people, unless I know what has been
And what shall be, unless I know their skills
And practices and works and lives and names
Of them and their fathers and mothers
And brothers and friends, even of those now dead,
I will pour the blood of the black-faced jackal
As an offering in a new-made jar and put it
In the fire and burn beneath it what’s left
Of the bones of all-praised Osiris,
And I will shout in the port of Busiris
The secrets of his mysteries, that his body,
Drowned, remained in the river three days
And three nights, that he, the praised one,
Was carried by the river into the sea
And surrounded by wave on wave on wave
And by mist rising off water through the air.
To keep your belly from being eaten by fish,
To keep the fish from chewing your flesh with their mouths,
To make the fish close their hungry jaws, to keep
The fatherless child from being taken
From his mother, to keep the pole of the sky
From being brought down and the twin towering
Mountains from toppling into one, to keep Anoixis
From running amok and doing just what she wants,
Not god or goddess will give oracles
Until I know through and through
Just what is in the minds of all human beings,
Egyptians, Syrians, Greeks, Ethyopians, of every race
And people, so that those who come to me.
Their eyes and mine can meet in a level gaze,
Neither one or the other higher or lower,
And whether they speak or keep silent,
I can tell them whatever has happened
And is happening and is going to happen
To them, and I can tell them their skills
And their works and their names and those of their dead,
And of every human being who comes to me
I will read them as I read a sealed letter
And tell them everything truthfully.
    5 / from brooklyn bridge
Sun shines on the third bridge tower:
A garbage scow ploughs the water,
Maternal hull pushing is all out beyond
The city, pushing it all out so patiently—
All you could hear out there this flawless afternoon
Is the sound of sand pulverizing newsprint
To tatters, paper-pulp ripping crosswise
Or lengthwise, shearing off some photo
Of maybe a head or maybe an arm.
Ridiculous flimsy noble newspaper,
Leaping in wind, fluttering, collapsing,
Its columns sway and topple into babble:
All you’d see if you were out there
Is air vanishing into clearer air.
    6 / from the plane
Pressed against our seats, them released to air,
From the little plane windows we peered four thousand feet
Down to the ground desert-gray and still,
Nothing seeming to be moving on that perfect afternoon,
No reminder of why it was we were all looking,
Remembering maybe the oh so flimsy
Wooden sawhorse police barricades, as the woman
In front of me twisted her head back to see
It all again, but up there there was nothing to see,
Only the reef water feel of transparency
Deepening down to a depth where everything
Goes dark and nothing moves unless it belongs
To that dark, darting in and out or undulating
Slowly or cruising unblinking, jaws open or closed.
    7 / spell broken by suppliant to helios for protection
                   from the Greek Magical Papyri
This is the charm that will protect you, the charm
That you must wear: Onto lime wood write
With vermilion the secret name, name of
The fifty magic letters. Then say the words:
“Guard me from every daimon of the air,
On the earth and under the earth, guard me
From every angel and phantom, every
Ghostly visitation and enchantment,
Me, your suppliant.” Enclose it in a skin
Dyed purple, hang it round your neck and wear it.
    8 / roll of film: photographer missing
Vines of smoke through latticework of steel
Weave the air into a garden of smoke.
And in the garden people came and went,
People of smoke and people of flesh, the air dressed
In ash. What the pictures couldn’t say
Was spoken by the smoke: A common language
In a tongue of smoke that murmured in every ear
Something about what it was they’d been forced
To endure: Words spoken in duress,
Inconsolable words, words spoken under the earth
That rooted in smoke and breathed in the smoke
And put forth shoots that twined through the steel,
Words plunged through the roof of the garages’
Voids, I-beams twisted; the eye that saw all this
Tells and tells again one part of the story
Of that day of wandering through the fatal garden,
The camera’s eye open and acutely
Recording in the foul-smelling air.
    9 / lamentation on ur
                               from a Sumerian spell, 2000 B.C.
Like molten bronze and iron shed blood
          pools. Our country’s dead
melt into the earth
          as grease melts in the sun, men whose
helmets now lie scattered, men annihilated
by the double-bladed axe. Heavy, beyond
          help, they lie still as a gazelle
exhausted in a trap,
          muzzle in the dust. In home
after home, empty doorways frame the absence
of mothers and fathers who vanished
          in the flames remorselessly
spreading claiming even
          frightened children who lay quiet
in their mother’s arms, now borne into
oblivion, like swimmers swept out to sea
          by the surging current.
May the great barred gate
          of blackest night again swing shut
on silent hinges. Destroyed in its turn,
may this disaster too be torn out of mind.

Deep in a vale, a stranger now to arms,Too poor to shine in courts, too proud to beg,He, who once warred on Saratoga’s plains,Sits musing o’er his scars, and wooden leg. Remembering still the toil of former days,To other hands he sees his earnings paid;--They share the due reward—he feeds on praise.Lost in the abyss of want, misfortune’s shade. Far, far from domes where splendid tapers glare,‘Tis his from dear bought peace no wealth to win,Removed alike from courtly cringing ‘squires,The great-man’s Levee, and the proud man’s grin. Sold are those arms which once on Britons blazed,When, flushed with conquest, to the charge they came;That power repelled, and Freedom’s fabrick raised,She leaves her soldier—famine and a name!

He woke, fully clothed, in his bed. He
remembered only one thing, the birds, how
when he came in, he had gone around the rooms
and got them back in their cage, the green one first,
she with the bad leg, and then the blue,
the one they had hoped was a male
 
Otherwise? Yes, Fernand, who had talked lispingly of Albers & Angkor Vat.
He had left the party without a word. How he got up, got into his coat,
I do not know. When I saw him, he was at the door, but it did not matter,
he was already sliding along the wall of the night, losing himself
in some crack of the ruins. That it should have been he who said, “The kingfishers!
who cares
for their feathers
now?”
 
His last words had been, “The pool is slime.” Suddenly everyone,
ceasing their talk, sat in a row around him, watched
they did not so much hear, or pay attention, they
wondered, looked at each other, smirked, but listened,
he repeated and repeated, could not go beyond his thought
“The pool    the kingfishers’ feathers were wealth    why
did the export stop?”
 
It was then he left

                    but the kingfisher flew west
est devant nous!
                    he got the color of his breast
                    from the heat of the setting sun!
 
The features are, the feebleness of the feet (syndactylism of the 3rd & 4th digit)
the bill, serrated, sometimes a pronounced beak, the wings
where the color is, short and round, the tail
inconspicuous.
 
But not these things were the factors. Not the birds.
The legends are
legends. Dead, hung up indoors, the kingfisher
will not indicate a favoring wind,
or avert the thunderbolt. Nor, by its nesting,
still the waters, with the new year, for seven days.
It is true, it does nest with the opening year, but not on the waters.
It nests at the end of a tunnel bored by itself in a bank. There,
six or eight white and translucent eggs are laid, on fishbones
not on bare clay, on bones thrown up in pellets by the birds.
 
                                                   On these rejectamenta
(as they accumulate they form a cup-shaped structure) the young are born.
And, as they are fed and grow, this nest of excrement and decayed fish becomes
                                                              a dripping, fetid mass

                       “animals likewise,

                       “last, two birds, of thread and featherwork, the quills
                        gold, the feet
                        gold, the two birds perched on two reeds
 
                        gold, the reeds arising from two embroidered mounds,
                        one yellow, the other

In this instance, the priests
(in dark cotton robes, and dirty,
their disheveled hair matted with blood, and flowing wildly
over their shoulders)
rush in among the people, calling on them
to protect their gods

The leaves of blue came drifting down.
In the corner Madeleine Reierbacher was reading Lorna Doone.
The bay’s water helped to implement the structuring of the garden hose.
The envelope fell. Was it pink or was it red? Consult Lorna Doone.
There, voyager, you will find your answer. The savant grapeade stands
Remember Madeleine Reierbacher. Madeleine Reierbacher says,
“If you are happy, there is no one to keep you from being happy;
Don’t let them!” Madeleine Reierbacher went into the racing car.
The racing car was orange and red. Madeleine Reierbacher drove to Beale Street.
There Maddy doffed her garments to get into some more comfortable clothes.
Jazz was already playing in Beale Street when Madeleine Reierbacher arrived there.
Madeleine Reierbacher picked up the yellow horn and began to play.
No one had ever heard anything comparable to the playing of Madeleine Reierbacher.
What a jazz musician! The pianist missed his beats because he was so excited.
The drummer stared out the window in ecstasy at the yellow wooden trees.
The orchestra played “September in the Rain,” “Mugging,” and “I’m Full of Love.”
Madeleine Reierbacher rolled up her sleeves; she picked up her horn; she played “Blues in the Rain.”
It was the best jazz anyone had ever heard. It was mentioned in the newspapers. St. Louis!
Madeleine Reierbacher became a celebrity. She played with Pesky Summerton and Muggsy Pierce.
Madeleine cut numerous disks. Her best waxings are “Alpha Beta and Gamma”
And “Wing Song.” One day Madeleine was riding on a donkey
When she came to a yellow light; the yellow light did not change.
Madeleine kept hoping it would change to green or red. She said, “As long as you have confidence,
You need be afraid of nothing.” Madeleine saw the red smokestacks, she looked at the thin trees,
And she regarded the railroad tracks. The yellow light was unchanging. Madeleine’s donkey dropped dead
From his mortal load. Madeleine Reierbacher, when she fell to earth,
Picked up a blade of grass and began to play. “The Blues!” cried the workmen of the vicinity,
And they ran and came in great numbers to where Madeleine Reierbacher was.
They saw her standing in that simple field beside the railroad track
Playing, and they saw that light changing to green and red, and they saw that donkey stand up
And rise into the sky; and Madeleine Reierbacher was like a clot of blue
In the midst of the blue of all that sky, and the young farmers screamed
In excitement, and the workmen dropped their heavy boards and stones in their excitement,
And they cried, “O Madeleine Reierbacher, play us the ‘Lead Flint Blues’ once again!”
O railroad stations, pennants, evenings, and lumberyards!
When will you ever bring us such a beautiful soloist again?
An argent strain shows on the reddish face of the sun.
Madeleine Reierbacher stands up and screams, “I am getting wet! You are all egotists!”
Her brain floats up into the lyric atmosphere of the sky.
We must figure out a way to keep our best musicians with us.
The finest we have always melt in the light blue sky!
In the middle of a concert, sometimes, they disappear, like anvils.
(The music comes down to us with sweet white hands on our shoulders.)
We stare up in surprise; and we hear Madeleine’s best-known tune once again,
“If you ain’t afraid of life, life can’t be afraid for you.”
Madeleine! Come back and sing to us!
                                                      2
Dick looked up from his blackboard.
Had he really written a history of the jazz age?
He stared at his television set; the technicolor jazz program was coming on.
The program that day was devoted to pictures of Madeleine Reierbacher
Playing her saxophone in the golden age of jazz.
Dick looked at his blackboard. It was a mass of green and orange lines.
Here and there a red chalk line interlaced with the others.
He stared attentively at the program.
It was a clear and blue white day. Amos said, “The calibration is finished. Now there need be no more jazz.”
In his mountain home old Lucas Dog laughed when he heard what Amos had said.
He smilingly picked up his yellow horn to play, but all that came out of it was steam.

As usual, the first gate was modest. It is dilapidated. She can’t tell
which bridge crossed the moat, which all cross sand now, disordered with footsteps.
It’s a precise overlay of circles on squares, but she has trouble locating
the main avenue and retraces her steps in intense heat for the correct entrance,
which was intentionally blurred, the  way a round arch can give onto a red wall,
far enough in back of the arch for sun to light.
If being by yourself separates from your symmetry, which is
the axis of your spine in the concrete sense, but becomes a suspension
in your spine like a layer of sand under the paving stones of a courtyard
or on a plain, you have to humbly seek out a person who can listen to you,
on a street crowded with bicycles at night, their bells ringing.
And any stick or straight line you hold can be your spine,
like a map she is following in French of Tan Tien. She wants space to fall
to each side of her like traction, not weight dispersed within a mirror. At any time,
an echo of what she says will multiply against the walls in balanced,
dizzying jumps like a gyroscope in the heat, but she is alone.
Later, she would remember herself as a carved figure and its shadow on a blank board,
but she is her balancing stick, and the ground to each side of her is its length,
disordered once by an armored car, and once by an urn of flowers at a crossing.
The stick isn’t really the temple’s bisection around her, like solstice or ancestor.
This Tang Dynasty peach tree would be parallel levitation in the spine
the person recording it.
Slowly the hall looms up. The red stair’s outline gives way to its duration
as it extends and rises at a low angle.
In comparison to the family, the individual hardly counts, but they all
wait for her at a teahouse inside the wall.
First the gold knob, then blue tiers above the highest step,
the same color as the sky.
When one person came to gain confidence,
she imagines he felt symmetry as flight after his fast among seven meteorites
in the dark. He really felt like a globe revolving within a globe.
Even the most singular or indivisible particle or heavenly sphere will adjust
when the axis extending beyond itself is pushed, or the sphere it is within
is pushed. What she thought was her balance flattens into a stylized dragon
on the marble paving stones.
Yet she’s reluctant to leave the compound. Only the emperor
could walk its center line. Now, anyone can imagine how it felt
to bring heaven news. She is trying to remember this in Hong Kong
as the tram pulls suddenly above skyscrapers and the harbor
and she flattens against her seat, like a reversal occurring in the poles,
or what she meant by, no one can imagine how.

 Considering Myrna Báez’s painting Platanal, E. Carmen Ramos explains, “When Puerto Rico was a Spanish colony, artists like Francisco Oller depicted the plantain as both a key accoutrement to the jibaro (rural peasant) and a metaphor for the island’s independent cultural identity.”  
Plantain trees gather at the edge
of the orchard, clamor for light
in the foreground. They seem to grow
as one, as if they’d fill the field
and the mountains behind them,
leaves large and frayed. We stood
there, once, or someplace like it, so
here we are again, it seems,
years later, branches leaning over
the road, you in your long skirt,
looking out as if to recall something
you meant to do. My country, I hear
you say still. But if that’s dusk
in the hills, you know what’s
coming to the field. You’ll stand
among them till there’s nothing left
to see. I’ll wait beside you, though
I don’t know what we’re waiting for.

My house stands opposite, on the other hill,
Among meadows, with the orchard fences down and falling;   
Deer come almost to the door.
You cannot see it, even in this clearest morning.
White birds hang in the air between
Over the garbage landfill and those homes thereto adjacent,   
Hovering slowly, turning, settling down

Riot in Algeria, in Cyprus, in Alabama;

Rudolph Reed was oaken.
His wife was oaken too.
And his two good girls and his good little man
Oakened as they grew.
“I am not hungry for berries.
I am not hungry for bread.
But hungry hungry for a house
Where at night a man in bed
”May never hear the plaster
Stir as if in pain.
May never hear the roaches
Falling like fat rain.
“Where never wife and children need
Go blinking through the gloom.
Where every room of many rooms
Will be full of room.
”Oh my home may have its east or west
Or north or south behind it.
All I know is I shall know it,
And fight for it when I find it.“
It was in a street of bitter white
That he made his application.
For Rudolph Reed was oakener
Than others in the nation.
The agent’s steep and steady stare
Corroded to a grin.Why, you black old, tough old hell of a man,

The trouble was not about finding acceptance.
Acceptance was available in the depths of the mind
And among like people. The trouble was the look into the canyon
Which had come a long time earlier
And spent many years being forgotten.
 
The fine garments and rows of strong shoes,
The pantry stocked with good grains and butter—
Everything could be earned by producing right answers.
Answers were important, the canyon said,
But the answers were not the solution.
 
A glimpse into the future had shown the prairie
On which houses stood sturdily.
The earth was moist and generous, the sunlight benevolent.
The homesteaders dreamed up palaces and descendants,
And the animals slept soundly as stones.
 
It was a hard-earned heaven, the self-making
Of travelers, and often, out on the plains,
Mirages rose of waterfalls, moose, and rows of fresh-plowed soil,
But nobody stopped to drink the false water.
Real water being plentiful, they were not thirsty.
 
A few made their fortunes from native beauty,
Others from native strength, but most from knowledge,
As uncertainties in science could be written off to faith.
Faith was religious and ordinary life physical,
And spiritual was a song that had not yet arrived.

We pulled for you when the wind was against us and the sails were low.            Will you never let us go?
We ate bread and onions when you took towns, or ran aboard quickly when you were beaten back by the foe.
The Captains walked up and down the deck in fair weather singing songs, but we were below.
We fainted with our chins on the oars and you did not see that we were idle, for we still swung to and fro.            Will you never let us go?
The salt made the oar-handles like shark-skin; our knees were cut to the bone with salt-cracks; our hair was stuck to our foreheads; and our lips were cut to the gums, and you whipped us because we could not row.
            Will you never let us go?
But, in a little time, we shall run out of the port-holes as the water runs along the oar-blade, and though you tell the others to row after us you will never catch us till you catch the oar-thresh and tie up the winds in the belly of the sail. Aho!

So faintly green a small white check between
Balanced the field’s wide lawn, a plaid
Gathering in loose folds shaped around him
Those Princeton mornings, slowly stage-lit, when
The dawn took the horizon by surprise
And from the marsh long, crayoned birds
Rose up, ravens, maybe crows, or raw-voiced,
Spiteful grackles with their clothespin legs,
Black-winged gossips rising out of mud

Sooner or later he’d reach for me
And, half asleep, wriggle into my arms.

Would gradually illuminate the room,
The world turn on its axis at a different slant,
The furniture a shipwreck, the floor askew,
And, in old slippers, he’d bumble down the stairs.
Genius is human and wants its coffee hot—

For hours at breakfast, dawdling over notes,
Juice and toast at hand, the world awake
To spring, the smell of honeysuckle
Filling the kitchen. A silent man,
Silence became him most. How gently
He softened the edges of a guessed-at impact

A blow like soft snow falling on a lamb.
He’d fly down from the heights to tie his shoes
And cross the seas to get a glass of milk,
Bismarck with a harp, who’d doff his hat

On nimble feet so not to startle. He walked
In grandeur much too visible to be seen—
And how many versions crawled out of the Press!

A Frankenstein of test tubes; a “refugee”—
A shaman full of secrets who could touch
Physics with a wand and body forth

From signs Phoenicians scratched into the sand
With sticks he drew the contraries of space:
Whirlwind Nothing and Volume in its rage
Of matter racing to undermine itself,
And when the planets sang, why, he sang back
The lieder black holes secretly adore.
At tea at Mercer Street every afternoon
His manners went beyond civility,
Kindness not having anything to learn;
I was completely charmed. And fooled.
What a false view of the universe I had!
The horsehair sofa, the sagging chairs,
A fire roaring behind the firesecreen—
Imagine thinking Princeton was the world!
Yet I wore prescience like a second skin:
When Greenwich and Palomar saw eye to eye,
Time and space having found their rabbi,

were hungry until we GIs fed them. We dusted them with DDT. Hardly done. Reha-
bilitation of Korea, that is. It needs chemical fertilizer from the States, power to build
things like a country. In the end it was the hardliest of wars made up of bubble gum,
which GIs had to show those kids how to chew. In no circumstance whatever can
man be comfortable without art. They don’t want everlasting charity, and we are not
giving it to them. We are just lending them a hand until they can stand on their own
two feet. A novel idea. This is why it occurred to me that this particular war was
hardly war, the hardliest of wars.
 
 
My father was hardly himself during the war, then I was born during the era that
hardly existed, and, therefore, I hardly existed without DDT. Beauty is pleasure re-
garded as the quality of a thing. I prefer a paper closet with real paper dresses in
it. To be born hardly, hardly after the hardliest of wars, is a matter of debate. Still
going forward. We are, that is. Napalm again. This is THE BIG PICTURE. War and its
masses. War and its men. War and its machines. Together we form THE BIG PIC-
TURE. From Korea to Germany, from Alaska to Puerto Rico. All over the world, the
US Army is on the alert to defend our country, you the people, against aggression.
This is THE BIG PICTURE, an official television report to the nation from the army.
This is Korea! Is one thing better than another? These South Koreans are all right.
Woe is you, woe is war, hardly war, woe is me, woe are you? My father is still alive,
and this is how I came to prefer a paper closet with real paper dresses in it.
 
 
Well, it’s morning in Korea. The most violently mountainous place on Earth. Every-
one has been dusted, existence hardly done, whereas beauty has been regarded as
the quality of a thing. At Uncle Dann’s Huddle doughnuts and coffee are free and in
case there are any, for there are many, the unescorted ladies are not permitted. The
decision has been made in Tokyo for the hardliest of wars, an old soldier made it.
The situation in Korea is so critical that we the Navy must give the Eighth Army prac-
tical support. Do you remember how you began this day? How did you spend this
morning? Woe are you? Well, pinecones fall every day. So why do we fail? Miles and
miles of homeless refugees set adrift by the Red scourge.

                    Spain: Anno 1492
                ","
Torquemada. Now that Castile and Aragon in holy wedlock
are Spain,
and the last city of the Moors in Spain is Spanish
except for Moor and Jew—
about every crucifix in every market-place
and in the court itself the Jews!—
as seven centuries of Christian valor, Christian piety
triumph
stay not your hand;
Spain of the knights,
one in fealty to your majesties,
become one in faith,
Spain of the saints!
Like the sun,
rising as our Savior from His tomb into the brilliant sky
blaze
until the clouds that still obscure the light
are drawn into His brightness
and earth is brilliant as the sky is bright.
Spain newly united
still divided—
as the season of cold is the season of darkness
in the spring of our rejoicing that the Moor is gone from Spain,
the Jew go too!
But if the Spaniard speaks,
I speak no less a Christian:
throw away the curse, you Jews,
of fifteen hundred years;
stay and prosper
and Church and Heaven prosper,
in our nets a goodly catch.
Think not that we want aught of you
but your souls;
your money and your jewels—
all your trash—
keep if you stay and are Christian,
take if you are Jews and go;
we ask of you nothing but your Judaism
which has brought you so much misery
and will bring each of you—
the youngest and the gentlest—
to the flames of Hell
and the worm that dies not.
We give you,
miserable sinners,
the waters of
Paradise;
we give you the blessings of the saints,
the blessings of Mary, the blessed mother of Christ,
and the blessings of our Lord Jesus.
   Isabella. There is a sweet reasonableness in the words of our
      prior;
it is Saint Dominic who speaks to us
through his Dominican or Saint James himself.
   Abrabanel. No noble in your court, your majesties,
proud of his forefather, conquering Goth or Visigoth or Vandal,
is of an older Spanish line than we—
Jews in Iberia before the Romans came.
No noble boasting his service
boasts of more than that Jew who through a thousand shoals
   and reefs
piloted Aragon to Castile—your marriage and Spain’s glory.
The rest of us, many tens of thousands,
serve you humbly
in smithy, field or vineyard, soldiers or physicians,
as we have served in Spain two thousand years,
Spaniards, true to your majesties
as we are to the God of Israel—and of Spain,
unlike the others only in our faith
for which, if we must answer,
we shall answer to our God.
   Torquemada. Since all we do,
and each word spoken, if only in our hearts,
must be in worship—
not a leaf falls slowly but in His service—
to be unlike us in our faith
is to be unlike in everything.
True, you Jews must answer to your God,
and in the flames and burning ice of Hell forever
you shall answer;
but we too, priests, bishops, queen and king,
must answer for you:
farmer or captain answers;
shall we be less answerable for souls?
   Abrabanel. You do not honor your God
by bringing Him captives,
like a mere emperor
who must have retainers and retinue,
serfs and forced labor;
the loadstone
without visible motion
draws to itself every particle of iron;
the sword—even though a winged angel swings it—
served only
to drive Adam from his paradise.
Your fingers stiff with rings and jewels,
you dishonor your faith, your majesties, by cruelty,
give it whatever noble name you will
as princes make a rogue knight or lord.
Will thieves and pirates be gentler with us
than your constables and soldiers?—
your majesties will hear of many
ripped up for the jewels it will be said they swallowed;
many left by sailors to die on reefs and sandbars
for a smock or a pair of hose; many dead of plague
or found like birds in winter
dead in the fields about towns or like fish upon a beach;
many will die as slaves at work
beasts would be fitter for but costlier,
who have written a page of Castilian
or handled a Toledo blade with the best.
And yet the weak has each his strength,
Spain of Spaniard, Basque, and Catalonian, Moor and Gypsy,
else all beasts were tigers,
all fish sharks,
and only giants left;
the stricken remember—
as wounds and scars last longer than the blow—
and if drops of water wear channels in the rock
on which the earth itself is,
in the action of centuries
how powerful are tears.
Would you have our religion
like our clothes—for comfort and the eyes of men,
put off at night,
and we left lying naked in the darkness?
The body is like roots stretching down into the earth—
forcing still a way over stones and under rock, through sand,
sucking nourishment in darkness,
bearing the tread of man and beast,
and of the earth forever;
but the spirit—
twigs and leaves
spreading
through sunshine
or the luminous darkness
of twilight, evening, night, and dawn,
moving
in every wind of heaven
and turning
to whatever corner of the sky is brightest,
compelled by nothing stronger than the light;
the body is like earth,
the spirit like water
without which earth is sand
and which must be free or stagnant;
or if the body is as water,
the spirit is like air
that must have doors and windows
or else is stuffy and unbreathable—
or like the fire
of which sun and stars have been compounded,
which Joshua could command but for an hour.
   Isabella. If our eye offends us,
pluck it out!
Even so, we will sweep away the Jews
from every town and hamlet, field and corner of our dominion,
though they are the sands for number.
Go and begone—but stay as Christians;
come and be dear to us,
as the Prodigal!
   Abrabanel. We Jews have been accused of love of wealth,
but not for all our wealth in Spain,
fields and vineyards, houses of timber and houses of stone
that we must leave,
and all the wealth that will be stolen from us,
will we stay;
we Jews have been accused of arrogance,
but not for all the dignities that we must leave,
our offices and honors
in this, the proudest court of Christendom,
will we stay;
we Jews have been accused of love of life,
delighting in the flesh,
but though we shall die along a thousand roads
we will not stay—
striking roots
somewhere
to flourish
as we flourished,
giving shade and fruit.

","
1 Adios, Carenage
In idle August, while the sea soft,
and leaves of brown islands stick to the rim   
of this Caribbean, I blow out the light   
by the dreamless face of Maria Concepcion   
to ship as a seaman on the schooner Flight.   
Out in the yard turning gray in the dawn,   
I stood like a stone and nothing else move   
but the cold sea rippling like galvanize   
and the nail holes of stars in the sky roof,   
till a wind start to interfere with the trees.   
I pass me dry neighbor sweeping she yard   
as I went downhill, and I nearly said:
“Sweep soft, you witch, ’cause she don’t sleep hard,”   
but the bitch look through me like I was dead.   
A route taxi pull up, park-lights still on.   
The driver size up my bags with a grin:   
“This time, Shabine, like you really gone!”
I ain’t answer the ass, I simply pile in   
the back seat and watch the sky burn   
above Laventille pink as the gown
in which the woman I left was sleeping,
and I look in the rearview and see a man   
exactly like me, and the man was weeping
for the houses, the streets, that whole fucking island.
Christ have mercy on all sleeping things!   
From that dog rotting down Wrightson Road   
to when I was a dog on these streets;   
if loving these islands must be my load,   
out of corruption my soul takes wings.   
But they had started to poison my soul
with their big house, big car, big-time bohbohl,   
coolie, nigger, Syrian, and French Creole,   
so I leave it for them and their carnival—
I taking a sea bath, I gone down the road.   
I know these islands from Monos to Nassau,   
a rusty head sailor with sea-green eyes   
that they nickname Shabine, the patois for   
any red nigger, and I, Shabine, saw   
when these slums of empire was paradise.   
I’m just a red nigger who love the sea,   
I had a sound colonial education,
I have Dutch, nigger, and English in me,   
and either I’m nobody, or I’m a nation,
But Maria Concepcion was all my thought   
watching the sea heaving up and down
as the port side of dories, schooners, and yachts   
was painted afresh by the strokes of the sun   
signing her name with every reflection;
I knew when dark-haired evening put on
her bright silk at sunset, and, folding the sea,   
sidled under the sheet with her starry laugh,   
that there’d be no rest, there’d be no forgetting.
Is like telling mourners round the graveside   
about resurrection, they want the dead back,   
so I smile to myself as the bow rope untied
and the Flight swing seaward: “Is no use repeating   
that the sea have more fish. I ain’t want her   
dressed in the sexless light of a seraph,
I want those round brown eyes like a marmoset, and   
till the day when I can lean back and laugh,   
those claws that tickled my back on sweating   
Sunday afternoons, like a crab on wet sand.”   
As I worked, watching the rotting waves come   
past the bow that scissor the sea like silk,   
I swear to you all, by my mother’s milk,   
by the stars that shall fly from tonight’s furnace,   
that I loved them, my children, my wife, my home;   
I loved them as poets love the poetry   
that kills them, as drowned sailors the sea.
You ever look up from some lonely beach   
and see a far schooner? Well, when I write   
this poem, each phrase go be soaked in salt;   
I go draw and knot every line as tight   
as ropes in this rigging; in simple speech   
my common language go be the wind,   
my pages the sails of the schooner Flight.   
But let me tell you how this business begin.2 Raptures of the Deep
Smuggled Scotch for O’Hara, big government man,   
between Cedros and the Main, so the Coast Guard couldn’t touch us,
and the Spanish pirogues always met us halfway,
but a voice kept saying: “Shabine, see this business   
of playing pirate?” Well, so said, so done!   
That whole racket crash. And I for a woman,   
for her laces and silks, Maria Concepcion.
Ay, ay! Next thing I hear, some Commission of Inquiry
was being organized to conduct a big quiz,
with himself as chairman investigating himself.   
Well, I knew damn well who the suckers would be,   
not that shark in shark skin, but his pilot fish,   
khaki-pants red niggers like you and me.   
What worse, I fighting with Maria Concepcion,   
plates flying and thing, so I swear: “Not again!”   
It was mashing up my house and my family.   
I was so broke all I needed was shades and a cup
or four shades and four cups in four-cup Port of Spain;
all the silver I had was the coins on the sea.
You saw them ministers in The Express,   
guardians of the poor—one hand at their back,   
and one set o’ police only guarding their house,   
and the Scotch pouring in through the back door.
As for that minister-monster who smuggled the booze,
that half-Syrian saurian, I got so vex to see
that face thick with powder, the warts, the stone lids   
like a dinosaur caked with primordial ooze
by the lightning of flashbulbs sinking in wealth,   
that I said: “Shabine, this is shit, understand!”
But he get somebody to kick my crutch out his office   
like I was some artist! That bitch was so grand,   
couldn’t get off his high horse and kick me himself.   
I have seen things that would make a slave sick   
in this Trinidad, the Limers’ Republic.
I couldn’t shake the sea noise out of my head,   
the shell of my ears sang Maria Concepcion,   
so I start salvage diving with a crazy Mick,   
name O’Shaugnessy, and a limey named Head;   
but this Caribbean so choke with the dead   
that when I would melt in emerald water,   
whose ceiling rippled like a silk tent,
I saw them corals: brain, fire, sea fans,   
dead-men’s-fingers, and then, the dead men.   
I saw that the powdery sand was their bones   
ground white from Senegal to San Salvador,   
so, I panic third dive, and surface for a month   
in the Seamen’s Hostel. Fish broth and sermons.   
When I thought of the woe I had brought my wife,   
when I saw my worries with that other woman,   
I wept under water, salt seeking salt,
for her beauty had fallen on me like a sword   
cleaving me from my children, flesh of my flesh!
There was this barge from St. Vincent, but she was too deep   
to float her again. When we drank, the limey   
got tired of my sobbing for Maria Concepcion.   
He said he was getting the bends. Good for him!   
The pain in my heart for Maria Concepcion,   
the hurt I had done to my wife and children,
was worse than the bends. In the rapturous deep   
there was no cleft rock where my soul could hide   
like the boobies each sunset, no sandbar of light   
where I could rest, like the pelicans know,
so I got raptures once, and I saw God
like a harpooned grouper bleeding, and a far   
voice was rumbling, “Shabine, if you leave her,
if you leave her, I shall give you the morning star.”   
When I left the madhouse I tried other women   
but, once they stripped naked, their spiky cunts   
bristled like sea eggs and I couldn’t dive.   
The chaplain came round. I paid him no mind.   
Where is my rest place, Jesus? Where is my harbor?   
Where is the pillow I will not have to pay for,
and the window I can look from that frames my life?3 Shabine Leaves the Republic
I had no nation now but the imagination.
After the white man, the niggers didn’t want me   
when the power swing to their side.
The first chain my hands and apologize, “History”;   
the next said I wasn’t black enough for their pride.   
Tell me, what power, on these unknown rocks—
a spray-plane Air Force, the Fire Brigade,
the Red Cross, the Regiment, two, three police dogs   
that pass before you finish bawling “Parade!”?   
I met History once, but he ain’t recognize me,   
a parchment Creole, with warts
like an old sea bottle, crawling like a crab
through the holes of shadow cast by the net
of a grille balcony; cream linen, cream hat.
I confront him and shout, “Sir, is Shabine!
They say I’se your grandson. You remember Grandma,   
your black cook, at all?” The bitch hawk and spat.   
A spit like that worth any number of words.
But that’s all them bastards have left us: words.
I no longer believed in the revolution.
I was losing faith in the love of my woman.   
I had seen that moment Aleksandr Blok   
crystallize in The Twelve. Was between
the Police Marine Branch and Hotel Venezuelana   
one Sunday at noon. Young men without flags   
using shirts, their chests waiting for holes.   
They kept marching into the mountains, and   
their noise ceased as foam sinks into sand.   
They sank in the bright hills like rain, every one   
with his own nimbus, leaving shirts in the street,   
and the echo of power at the end of the street.   
Propeller-blade fans turn over the Senate;   
the judges, they say, still sweat in carmine,   
on Frederick Street the idlers all marching   
by standing still, the Budget turns a new leaf.   
In the 12:30 movies the projectors best
not break down, or you go see revolution. Aleksandr Blok   
enters and sits in the third row of pit eating choc-
olate cone, waiting for a spaghetti West-
ern with Clint Eastwood and featuring Lee Van Cleef.4 The Flight, Passing Blanchisseuse
Dusk. The Flight passing Blanchisseuse.   
Gulls wheel like. from a gun again,   
and foam gone amber that was white,   
lighthouse and star start making friends,   
down every beach the long day ends,   
and there, on that last stretch of sand,   
on a beach bare of all but light,   
dark hands start pulling in the seine   
of the dark sea, deep, deep inland.5 Shabine Encounters the Middle Passage
Man, I brisk in the galley first thing next dawn,   
brewing li’l coffee; fog coil from the sea   
like the kettle steaming when I put it down   
slow, slow, ’cause I couldn’t believe what I see:   
where the horizon was one silver haze,   
the fog swirl and swell into sails, so close   
that I saw it was sails, my hair grip my skull,   
it was horrors, but it was beautiful.
We float through a rustling forest of ships   
with sails dry like paper, behind the glass
I saw men with rusty eyeholes like cannons,
and whenever their half-naked crews cross the sun,
right through their tissue, you traced their bones   
like leaves against the sunlight; frigates, barkentines,   
the backward-moving current swept them on,   
and high on their decks I saw great admirals,   
Rodney, Nelson, de Grasse, I heard the hoarse orders   
they gave those Shabines, and that forest   
of masts sail right through the Flight,   
and all you could hear was the ghostly sound   
of waves rustling like grass in a low wind   
and the hissing weeds they trailed from the stern;   
slowly they heaved past from east to west
like this round world was some cranked water wheel,   
every ship pouring like a wooden bucket   
dredged from the deep; my memory revolve   
on all sailors before me, then the sun
heat the horizon’s ring and they was mist.
Next we pass slave ships. Flags of all nations,   
our fathers below deck too deep, I suppose,
to hear us shouting. So we stop shouting. Who knows   
who his grandfather is, much less his name?   
Tomorrow our landfall will be the Barbados.6 The Sailor Sings Back to the Casuarinas
You see them on the low hills of Barbados   
bracing like windbreaks, needles for hurricanes,   
trailing, like masts, the cirrus of torn sails;   
when I was green like them, I used to think
those cypresses, leaning against the sea,
that take the sea noise up into their branches,   
are not real cypresses but casuarinas.   
Now captain just call them Canadian cedars.   
But cedars, cypresses, or casuarinas,   
whoever called them so had a good cause,   
watching their bending bodies wail like women   
after a storm, when some schooner came home   
with news of one more sailor drowned again.
Once the sound “cypress” used to make more sense   
than the green “casuarinas,” though, to the wind   
whatever grief bent them was all the same,   
since they were trees with nothing else in mind   
but heavenly leaping or to guard a grave;   
but we live like our names and you would have   
to be colonial to know the difference,   
to know the pain of history words contain,   
to love those trees with an inferior love,   
and to believe: “Those casuarinas bend   
like cypresses, their hair hangs down in rain   
like sailors’ wives. They’re classic trees, and we,   
if we live like the names our masters please,   
by careful mimicry might become men.”7 The Flight Anchors in Castries Harbor
When the stars self were young over Castries,
I loved you alone and I loved the whole world.   
What does it matter that our lives are different?
Burdened with the loves of our different children?   
When I think of your young face washed by the wind   
and your voice that chuckles in the slap of the sea?   
The lights are out on La Toc promontory,
except for the hospital. Across at Vigie
the marina arcs keep vigil. I have kept my own
promise, to leave you the one thing I own,
you whom I loved first: my poetry.
We here for one night. Tomorrow, the Flight will be gone.8 Fight with the Crew
It had one bitch on board, like he had me mark—
that was the cook, some Vincentian arse
with a skin like a gommier tree, red peeling bark,   
and wash-out blue eyes; he wouldn’t give me a ease,   
like he feel he was white. Had an exercise book,   
this same one here, that I was using to write   
my poetry, so one day this man snatch it
from my hand, and start throwing it left and right   
to the rest of the crew, bawling out, “Catch it,”   
and start mincing me like I was some hen   
because of the poems. Some case is for fist,   
some case is for tholing pin, some is for knife—
this one was for knife. Well, I beg him first,   
but he keep reading, “O my children, my wife,”   
and playing he crying, to make the crew laugh;   
it move like a flying fish, the silver knife
that catch him right in the plump of his calf,   
and he faint so slowly, and he turn more white
than he thought he was. I suppose among men   
you need that sort of thing. It ain’t right
but that’s how it is. There wasn’t much pain,
just plenty blood, and Vincie and me best friend,   
but none of them go fuck with my poetry again.9 Maria Concepcion & the Book of Dreams
The jet that was screeching over the Flight
was opening a curtain into the past.   
“Dominica ahead!”
                         “It still have Caribs there.”
“One day go be planes only, no more boat.”
“Vince, God ain’t make nigger to fly through the air.”   
“Progress, Shabine, that’s what it’s all about.
Progress leaving all we small islands behind.”
I was at the wheel, Vince sitting next to me
gaffing. Crisp, bracing day. A high-running sea.   
”Progress is something to ask Caribs about.
They kill them by millions, some in war,   
some by forced labor dying in the mines   
looking for silver, after that niggers; more   
progress. Until I see definite signs
that mankind change, Vince, I ain’t want to hear.   
Progress is history’s dirty joke.   
Ask that sad green island getting nearer.”
Green islands, like mangoes pickled in brine.
In such fierce salt let my wound be healed,
me, in my freshness as a seafarer.
That night, with the sky sparks frosty with fire,   
I ran like a Carib through Dominica,
my nose holes choked with memory of smoke;   
I heard the screams of my burning children,   
I ate the brains of mushrooms, the fungi   
of devil’s parasols under white, leprous rocks;   
my breakfast was leaf mold in leaking forests,   
with leaves big as maps, and when I heard noise   
of the soldiers’ progress through the thick leaves,   
though my heart was bursting, I get up and ran   
through the blades of balisier sharper than spears;   
with the blood of my race, I ran, boy, I ran   
with moss-footed speed like a painted bird;   
then I fall, but I fall by an icy stream under   
cool fountains of fern, and a screaming parrot   
catch the dry branches and I drowned at last   
in big breakers of smoke; then when that ocean   
of black smoke pass, and the sky turn white,   
there was nothing but Progress, if Progress is   
an iguana as still as a young leaf in sunlight.   
I bawl for Maria, and her Book of Dreams.
It anchored her sleep, that insomniac’s Bible,   
a soiled orange booklet with a cyclop’s eye   
center, from the Dominican Republic.
Its coarse pages were black with the usual   
symbols of prophecy, in excited Spanish;
an open palm upright, sectioned and numbered   
like a butcher chart, delivered the future.   
One night; in a fever, radiantly ill,
she say, “Bring me the book, the end has come.”   
She said: “I dreamt of whales and a storm,”   
but for that dream, the book had no answer.
A next night I dreamed of three old women   
featureless as silkworms, stitching my fate,   
and I scream at them to come out my house,   
and I try beating them away with a broom,   
but as they go out, so they crawl back again,   
until I start screaming and crying, my flesh   
raining with sweat, and she ravage the book   
for the dream meaning, and there was nothing;
my nerves melt like a jellyfish—that was when I broke—
they found me round the Savannah, screaming:
All you see me talking to the wind, so you think I mad.   
Well, Shabine has bridled the horses of the sea;   
you see me watching the sun till my eyeballs seared,   
so all you mad people feel Shabine crazy,
but all you ain’t know my strength, hear? The coconuts   
standing by in their regiments in yellow khaki,   
they waiting for Shabine to take over these islands,   
and all you best dread the day I am healed
of being a human. All you fate in my hand,
ministers, businessmen, Shabine have you, friend,   
I shall scatter your lives like a handful of sand,
I who have no weapon but poetry and
the lances of palms and the sea’s shining shield!10 Out of the Depths
Next day, dark sea. A arse-aching dawn.   
“Damn wind shift sudden as a woman mind.”
The slow swell start cresting like some mountain range
with snow on the top.
                               “Ay, Skipper, sky dark!”   
“This ain’t right for August.”
                                  “This light damn strange,   
this season, sky should be clear as a field.”
A stingray steeplechase across the sea,
tail whipping water, the high man-o’-wars   
start reeling inland, quick, quick an archery
of flying fish miss us! Vince say: “You notice?”   
and a black-mane squall pounce on the sail   
like a dog on a pigeon, and it snap the neck   
of the Flight and shake it from head to tail.   
“Be Jesus, I never see sea get so rough
so fast! That wind come from God back pocket!”   
“Where Cap’n headin? Like the man gone blind!”   
“If we’s to drong, we go drong, Vince, fock-it!”   
“Shabine, say your prayers, if life leave you any!”
I have not loved those that I loved enough.   
Worse than the mule kick of Kick-’Em-Jenny   
Channel, rain start to pelt the Flight between   
mountains of water. If I was frighten?
The tent poles of water spouts bracing the sky   
start wobbling, clouds unstitch at the seams   
and sky water drench us, and I hear myself cry,   
“I’m the drowned sailor in her Book of Dreams.”
I remembered them ghost ships, I saw me corkscrewing   
to the sea bed of sea worms, fathom pass fathom,   
my jaw clench like a fist, and only one thing   
hold me, trembling, how my family safe home.   
Then a strength like it seize me and the strength said:
“I from backward people who still fear God.”   
Let Him, in His might, heave Leviathan upward   
by the winch of His will, the beast pouring lace   
from his sea-bottom bed; and that was the faith   
that had fade from a child in the Methodist chapel   
in Chisel Street, Castries, when the whale-bell   
sang service and, in hard pews ribbed like the whale,   
proud with despair, we sang how our race   
survive the sea’s maw, our history, our peril,   
and now I was ready for whatever death will.   
But if that storm had strength, was in Cap’n face,   
beard beading with spray, tears salting his eyes,   
crucify to his post, that nigger hold fast   
to that wheel, man, like the cross held Jesus,   
and the wounds of his eyes like they crying for us,   
and I feeding him white rum, while every crest   
with Leviathan-lash make the Flight quail   
like two criminal. Whole night, with no rest,   
till red-eyed like dawn, we watch our travail   
subsiding, subside, and there was no more storm.   
And the noon sea get calm as Thy Kingdom come.11 After the Storm
There’s a fresh light that follows a storm
while the whole sea still havoc; in its bright wake   
I saw the veiled face of Maria Concepcion   
marrying the ocean, then drifting away
in the widening lace of her bridal train
with white gulls her bridesmaids, till she was gone.   
I wanted nothing after that day.
Across my own face, like the face of the sun,   
a light rain was falling, with the sea calm.
Fall gently, rain, on the sea’s upturned face   
like a girl showering; make these islands fresh   
as Shabine once knew them! Let every trace,   
every hot road, smell like clothes she just press   
and sprinkle with drizzle. I finish dream;   
whatever the rain wash and the sun iron:
the white clouds, the sea and sky with one seam,   
is clothes enough for my nakedness.   
Though my Flight never pass the incoming tide   
of this inland sea beyond the loud reefs   
of the final Bahamas, I am satisfied   
if my hand gave voice to one people’s grief.   
Open the map. More islands there, man,   
than peas on a tin plate, all different size,   
one thousand in the Bahamas alone,   
from mountains to low scrub with coral keys,   
and from this bowsprit, I bless every town,   
the blue smell of smoke in hills behind them,
and the one small road winding down them like twine
to the roofs below; I have only one theme:
The bowsprit, the arrow, the longing, the lunging heart—
the flight to a target whose aim we’ll never know,   
vain search for one island that heals with its harbor   
and a guiltless horizon, where the almond’s shadow   
doesn’t injure the sand. There are so many islands!   
As many islands as the stars at night
on that branched tree from which meteors are shaken
like falling fruit around the schooner Flight.   
But things must fall, and so it always was,   
on one hand Venus, on the other Mars;   
fall, and are one, just as this earth is one   
island in archipelagoes of stars.
My first friend was the sea. Now, is my last.   
I stop talking now. I work, then I read,   
cotching under a lantern hooked to the mast.   
I try to forget what happiness was,
and when that don’t work, I study the stars.   
Sometimes is just me, and the soft-scissored foam   
as the deck turn white and the moon open   
a cloud like a door, and the light over me   
is a road in white moonlight taking me home.   
Shabine sang to you from the depths of the sea.

Kind pity chokes my spleen; brave scorn forbids Those tears to issue which swell my eyelids; I must not laugh, nor weep sins and be wise; Can railing, then, cure these worn maladies? Is not our mistress, fair Religion, As worthy of all our souls' devotion As virtue was in the first blinded age? Are not heaven's joys as valiant to assuage Lusts, as earth's honour was to them? Alas, As we do them in means, shall they surpass Us in the end? and shall thy father's spirit Meet blind philosophers in heaven, whose merit Of strict life may be imputed faith, and hear Thee, whom he taught so easy ways and near To follow, damn'd? Oh, if thou dar'st, fear this; This fear great courage and high valour is. Dar'st thou aid mutinous Dutch, and dar'st thou lay Thee in ships' wooden sepulchres, a prey To leaders' rage, to storms, to shot, to dearth? Dar'st thou dive seas, and dungeons of the earth? Hast thou courageous fire to thaw the ice Of frozen North discoveries? and thrice Colder than salamanders, like divine Children in th' oven, fires of Spain and the Line, Whose countries limbecs to our bodies be, Canst thou for gain bear? and must every he Which cries not, ""Goddess,"" to thy mistress, draw Or eat thy poisonous words? Courage of straw! O desperate coward, wilt thou seem bold, and To thy foes and his, who made thee to stand Sentinel in his world's garrison, thus yield, And for forbidden wars leave th' appointed field? Know thy foes: the foul devil, whom thou Strivest to please, for hate, not love, would allow Thee fain his whole realm to be quit; and as The world's all parts wither away and pass, So the world's self, thy other lov'd foe, is In her decrepit wane, and thou loving this, Dost love a wither'd and worn strumpet; last, Flesh (itself's death) and joys which flesh can taste, Thou lovest, and thy fair goodly soul, which doth Give this flesh power to taste joy, thou dost loathe. Seek true religion. O where? Mirreus, Thinking her unhous'd here, and fled from us, Seeks her at Rome; there, because he doth know That she was there a thousand years ago, He loves her rags so, as we here obey The statecloth where the prince sate yesterday. Crantz to such brave loves will not be enthrall'd, But loves her only, who at Geneva is call'd Religion, plain, simple, sullen, young, Contemptuous, yet unhandsome; as among Lecherous humours, there is one that judges No wenches wholesome, but coarse country drudges. Graius stays still at home here, and because Some preachers, vile ambitious bawds, and laws, Still new like fashions, bid him think that she Which dwells with us is only perfect, he Embraceth her whom his godfathers will Tender to him, being tender, as wards still Take such wives as their guardians offer, or Pay values. Careless Phrygius doth abhor All, because all cannot be good, as one Knowing some women whores, dares marry none. Graccus loves all as one, and thinks that so As women do in divers countries go In divers habits, yet are still one kind, So doth, so is Religion; and this blind- ness too much light breeds; but unmoved, thou Of force must one, and forc'd, but one allow, And the right; ask thy father which is she, Let him ask his; though truth and falsehood be Near twins, yet truth a little elder is; Be busy to seek her; believe me this, He's not of none, nor worst, that seeks the best. To adore, or scorn an image, or protest, May all be bad; doubt wisely; in strange way To stand inquiring right, is not to stray; To sleep, or run wrong, is. On a huge hill, Cragged and steep, Truth stands, and he that will Reach her, about must and about must go, And what the hill's suddenness resists, win so. Yet strive so that before age, death's twilight, Thy soul rest, for none can work in that night. To will implies delay, therefore now do; Hard deeds, the body's pains; hard knowledge too The mind's endeavours reach, and mysteries Are like the sun, dazzling, yet plain to all eyes. Keep the truth which thou hast found; men do not stand In so ill case, that God hath with his hand Sign'd kings' blank charters to kill whom they hate; Nor are they vicars, but hangmen to fate. Fool and wretch, wilt thou let thy soul be tied To man's laws, by which she shall not be tried At the last day? Oh, will it then boot thee To say a Philip, or a Gregory, A Harry, or a Martin, taught thee this? Is not this excuse for mere contraries Equally strong? Cannot both sides say so? That thou mayest rightly obey power, her bounds know; Those past, her nature and name is chang'd; to be Then humble to her is idolatry. As streams are, power is; those blest flowers that dwell At the rough stream's calm head, thrive and do well, But having left their roots, and themselves given To the stream's tyrannous rage, alas, are driven Through mills, and rocks, and woods, and at last, almost Consum'd in going, in the sea are lost. So perish souls, which more choose men's unjust Power from God claim'd, than God himself to trust.

The youngest has been married off.
 
He is as tall as Abraham Lincoln. Here, on his
wedding day, he flaunts the high spinning laugh
of a newly freed slave. I stand above him, just
off the second-floor landing, watching
the celebration unfold.
 
Uncle-cousins, bosom buddies, convertible cars
of nosy paramours, strolling churlish penny-
pinchers pour onto the mansion estate. Below,
Strom Thurmond is dancing with my mother.
 
The favorite son of South Carolina has already
danced with the giddy bride and the giddy bride’s
mother. More women await: Easter dressy,
drenched in caramel, double exposed, triple cinched,
lined up, leggy, ready.
 
I refuse to leave the porch.
 
If I walk down I imagine he will extend his
hand, assume I am next in his happy darky line,
#427 on his dance card. His history
and mine, burnt cork and blackboard chalk,
concentric, pancaked, one face, two histories,
slow dragging, doing the nasty.
 
My father knows all this.
 
Daddy’s Black Chief Justice legs straddle the boilerplate
carapace of the CSS H. L. Hunley, lost Confederate
submarine, soon to be found just off the coast of
Charleston. He keeps it fully submerged by
applying the weight of every treatise he has
ever written against the death penalty of
South Carolina. Chanting “Briggs v. Elliott,”
he keeps the ironside door of the submarine shut.
No hands.
 
His eyes are a Black father’s beacon, search-
lights blazing for the married-off sons, and
on the unmarried, whale-eyed nose-in-book
daughter, born unmoored, quiet, yellow,
strategically placed under hospital lights to
fully bake. The one with the most to lose.
 
There will be no trouble. Still, he chain-
smokes. A burning stick of mint & Indian
leaf seesaws between his lips. He wants
me to remember that trouble is a fire that
runs like a staircase up then down. Even
on a beautiful day in June.
 
I remember the new research just out:
What the Negro gave America
Chapter 9,206:
 Enslaved Africans gifted porches to NorthAmerica. Once off the boats they were told,then made, to build themselves a place—to live. 
They build the house that will keep them alive.
 
Rather than be the bloody human floret on
yet another southern tree, they imagine higher
ground. They build landings with floor enough
to see the trouble coming. Their arced imaginations
nail the necessary out into the floral air. On the
backs and fronts of twentypenny houses,
a watching place is made for the ones who will
come tipping with torch & hog tie through the
quiet woods, hoping to hang them as decoration
in the porcupine hair of longleaf.
 
The architecture of Black people is sui generis.
This is architecture dreamed by the enslaved:
 
Their design will be stolen.
Their wits will outlast gold.
My eyes seek historical rest from the kiss-
kiss theater below; Strom Thurmond’s
it’s-never-too-late-to-forgive-me chivaree.
I search the tops of yellow pine while my
fingers reach, catch, pinch my father’s
determined-to-rise smoke.
 
Long before AC African people did the
math: how to cool down the hot air of
South Carolina?
 
If I could descend, without being trotted
out by some roughrider driven by his
submarine dreams, this is what I’d take
my time and scribble into the three-tiered,
white créme wedding cake:
 Filibuster. States’ Rights. The Grand Inquisitionof the great Thurgood Marshall. This weddingreception would not have been possible withoutthe Civil Rights Act of 1957 (opposed byyou-know-who). 
The Dixiecrat senator has not worn his
sandy seersucker fedora to the vows.
The top of Strom Thurmond’s bald head
reveals a birthmark tattooed in contrapposto
pose: Segregation Forever.
 
All my life he has been the face of hatred;
the blue eyes of the Confederate flag,
the pasty bald of white men pulling wooly
heads up into the dark skirts of trees,
the sharp, slobbering, amber teeth of
German shepherds, still clenched inside
the tissue-thin, (still marching), band-leader
legs of Black schoolteachers, the single-
minded pupae growing between the legs of
white boys crossing the tracks, ready to
force Black girls into fifth-grade positions,
Palmetto state-sanctioned sex 101.
 
I didn’t want to dance with him.
 
My young cousin arrives at my elbow.
Her beautiful lips the color of soft-skin
mangoes. She pulls, teasing the stitches
of my satin bridesmaid gown, “You better
go on down there and dance with Strom—
while he still has something left.”
 
I don’t tell her it is unsouthern for her
to call him by his first name, as if they
are familiar. I don’t tell her: To bear
witness to marriage is to believe that
everything moving through the sweet
wedding air can be confidently, left—
to Love.
 
I stand on the landing high above the
beginnings of Love, holding a plastic
champagne flute, drinking in the warm
June air of South Carolina. I hear my
youngest brother’s top hat joy. Looking
down I find him, deep in the giddy crowd,
modern, integrated, interpretive.
 
For ten seconds I consider dancing with
Strom. His Confederate hands touch
every shoulder, finger, back that I love.
I listen to the sound of Black laughter
shimmying. All worry floats beyond
the gurgling submarine bubbles,
the white railing, every drop of
champagne air.
 
I close my eyes and Uncle Freddie
appears out of a baby’s breath of fog.
(The dead are never porch bound.)
He moves with ease where I cannot.
He walks out on the rice-thrown air,
heaving a lightning bolt instead of
a wave. Suddenly, there is a table set,
complete with 1963 dining room stars,
they twinkle twinkle up & behind him.
Thelonious, Martin, Malcolm, Nina,
Dakota, all mouths Negro wide &
open have come to sing me down.
His tattered almanac sleeps curled like
a wintering slug in his back pocket.
His dark Dogon eyes jet to the scene
below, then zoom past me until they are
lost in the waning sugilite sky. Turning
in the shadows of the wheat fields,
he whispers a truth plucked from
the foreword tucked in his back pocket:Veritas: Black people will forgive you
quicker than you can say OrangeburgMassacre. 
History does not keep books on the
handiwork of slaves. But the enslaved
who built this Big House, long before
I arrived for this big wedding, knew
the power of a porch.
 
This native necessity of nailing down
a place, for the cooling off of air,
in order to lift the friendly, the kindly,
the so politely, the in-love-ly, jubilant,
into the arms of the grand peculiar,
for the greater good of
the public spectacular:

Two armies stand enrolled beneath The banner with the starry wreath; One, facing battle, blight and blast, Through twice a hundred fields has passed; Its deeds against a ruffian foe, Steam, valley, hill, and mountain know, Till every wind that sweeps the land Goes, glory laden, from the strand.   The other, with a narrower scope, Yet led by not less grand a hope, Hath won, perhaps, as proud a place, And wears its fame with meeker grace. Wives march beneath its glittering sign, Fond mothers swell the lovely line, And many a sweetheart hides her blush In the young patriot’s generous flush.   No breeze of battle ever fanned The colors of that tender band; Its office is beside the bed, Where throbs some sick or wounded head. It does not court the soldier’s tomb, But plies the needle and the loom; And, by a thousand peaceful deeds, Supplies a struggling nation’s needs.   Nor is that army’s gentle might Unfelt amid the deadly fight; It nerves the son’s, the husband's hand, It points the lover’s fearless brand; It thrills the languid, warms the cold, Gives even new courage to the bold; And sometimes lifts the veriest clod To its own lofty trust in God.   When Heaven shall blow the trump of peace, And bid this weary warfare cease, Their several missions nobly done, The triumph grasped, and freedom won, Both armies, from their toils at rest, Alike may claim the victor’s crest, But each shall see its dearest prize Gleam softly from the other’s eyes.

whose recounting was already foreclosed, as in a numeral smudged in powder, as in a thin water
making of the atmosphere a disc. It was a time of guzzling. A time amid what has been kept, a

                    Something Whispered in the Shakuhachi
","
No one knew the secret of my flutes,
and I laugh now
because some said I was enlightened.
But the truth is
I’m only a gardener
who before the War
was a dirt farmer and learned
how to grow the bamboo
in ditches next to the fields,
how to leave things alone
and let the silt build up
until it was deep enough to stink
bad as night soil, bad
as the long, witch-grey
hair of a ghost.
No secret in that.
My land was no good, rocky,
and so dry I had to sneak
water from the whites,
hacksaw the locks off the chutes at night,
and blame Mexicans, Filipinos,
or else some wicked spirit
of a migrant, murdered in his sleep
by sheriffs and wanting revenge.
Even though they never believed me,
it didn’t matter—no witnesses,
and my land was never thick with rice,
only the bamboo
growing lush as old melodies
and whispering like brush strokes
against the fine scroll of wind.
I found some string in the shed
or else took a few stalks
and stripped off their skins,
wove the fibers, the floss,
into cords I could bind
around the feet, ankles, and throats
of only the best bamboos.
I used an ice pick for an awl,
a fish knife to carve finger holes,
and a scythe to shape the mouthpiece.
I had my flutes.
                           *
When the War came,
I told myself I lost nothing.
My land, which was barren,
was not actually mine but leased
(we could not own property)
and the shacks didn’t matter.
What did were the power lines nearby
and that sabotage was suspected.
What mattered to me
were the flutes I burned
in a small fire
by the bath house.
                           *
All through Relocation,
in the desert where they put us,
at night when the stars talked
and the sky came down
and drummed against the mesas,
I could hear my flutes
wail like fists of wind
whistling through the barracks.
I came out of Camp,
a blanket slung over my shoulder,
found land next to this swamp,
planted strawberries and beanplants,
planted the dwarf pines and tended them,
got rich enough to quit
and leave things alone,
let the ditches clog with silt again
and the bamboo grow thick as history.
                           *
So, when it’s bad now,
when I can’t remember what’s lost
and all I have for the world to take
means nothing,
I go out back of the greenhouse
at the far end of my land
where the grasses go wild
and the arroyos come up
with cat’s-claw and giant dahlias,
where the children of my neighbors
consult with the wise heads
of sunflowers, huge against the sky,
where the rivers of weather
and the charred ghosts of old melodies
converge to flood my land
and sustain the one thicket
of memory that calls for me
to come and sit
among the tall canes
and shape full-throated songs
out of wind, out of bamboo,
out of a voice
that only whispers.

                    The Talking Day
                ","
Some lunatic with a gun killed some people at an
immigration center in Binghamton, New York. Liz
Rosenberg and her family live up there and David, her
husband, teaches in the middle school which is close to
all the action (the way, in any smallish town, everything is
close to all the action). I called Liz to see if everyone was
all right and she was in her car driving to the elementary
school to pick up Lily, her young daughter she brought
back from China a few years ago. Lily was fine, but
Liz wanted to move her outside the question of how to
make sense of the broken pieces of “someone” with a
gun walking into a public space and then firing. There’s
something called (I learned from a news report the day of
the shootings at Virginia Tech) The Talking Day which
refers to the day immediately following the day when
something wildly violent happens. No one quite grasps
the reality of the situation and everyone spends that first day
talking about what happened and reliving it as language—
not so much to understand the violence but to make a
kind of recording of it: talking about it, letting go of it,
putting it down. And so I imagine it must be with Liz and
Lily and David in Binghamton, New York today: letting
“something” go. Liz is in her car after having just picked up
Lily at school and driving back home through a town that
suddenly makes no sense and she is telling the story about
what happened when a young man walked into a building
with a gun. And for Lily, who’s had a pretty serene, un-
violent United States time so far and whose endless joy
has made her an adorable chatterbox, tomorrow could be
her first talking day. Or, if not tomorrow, some other day.
We live in a talking day world.

He dines alone surrounded by reflections   
of himself. Then after sleep and benzedrine   
descends the Cinquecento stair his magic   
wrought from hypochondria of the well-
to-do and nagging deathwish of the poor;   
swirls on smiling genuflections of
his liveried chauffeur into a crested   
lilac limousine, the cynosure
of mousey neighbors tittering behind   
Venetian blinds and half afraid of him   
and half admiring his outrageous flair.
       II
Meanwhile his mother, priestess in gold lamé,   
precedes him to the quondam theater   
now Israel Temple of the Highest Alpha,   
where the bored, the sick, the alien, the tired   
await euphoria. With deadly vigor
she prepares the way for mystery
and lucre. Shouts in blues-contralto, ”He’s   
God’s dictaphone of all-redeeming truth.
Oh he’s the holyweight champeen who’s come   
to give the knockout lick to your bad luck;   
say he’s the holyweight champeen who’s here   
to deal a knockout punch to your hard luck.“
       III
Reposing on cushions of black leopard skin,   
he telephones instructions for a long
slow drive across the park that burgeons now   
with spring and sailors. Peers questingly   
into the green fountainous twilight, sighs
and turns the gold-plate dial to Music For
Your Dining-Dancing Pleasure. Smoking Egyptian   
cigarettes rehearses in his mind
a new device that he must use tonight.
       IV
Approaching Israel Temple, mask in place,   
he hears ragtime allegros of a ”Song
of Zion“ that becomes when he appears   
a hallelujah wave for him to walk.
His mother and a rainbow-surpliced cordon   
conduct him choiring to the altar-stage,
and there he kneels and seems to pray before   
a lighted Jesus painted sealskin-brown.
Then with a glittering flourish he arises,   
turns, gracefully extends his draperied arms:   
“Israelites, true Jews, O found lost tribe   
of Israel, receive my blessing now.
Selah, selah.” He feels them yearn toward him   
as toward a lover, exults before the image
of himself their trust gives back. Stands as though   
in meditation, letting their eyes caress
his garments jewelled and chatoyant, cut   
to fall, to flow from his tall figure
dramatically just so. Then all at once
he sways, quivers, gesticulates as if
to ward off blows or kisses, and when he speaks   
again he utters wildering vocables,
hypnotic no-words planned (and never failing)   
to enmesh his flock in theopathic tension.   
Cries of eudaemonic pain attest
his artistry. Behind the mask he smiles.   
And now in subtly altering light he chants
and sinuously trembles, chants and trembles   
while convulsive energies of eager faith   
surcharge the theater with power of   
their own, a power he has counted on   
and for a space allows to carry him.   
Dishevelled antiphons proclaim the moment   
his followers all day have hungered for,   
but which is his alone.
He signals: tambourines begin, frenetic
drumbeat and glissando. He dances from the altar,   
robes hissing, flaring, shimmering; down aisles   
where mantled guardsmen intercept wild hands   
that arduously strain to clutch his vestments,   
he dances, dances, ensorcelled and aloof,   
the fervid juba of God as lover, healer,   
conjurer. And of himself as God.

Slave Sale: New Orleans
","
To begin with, the slaves had to wash themselves well,
and the men who had beards had to shave them off;
the men were then given a new suit each,
cheap but clean, and a hat, shirt, and shoes;
and the women were each given a frock of calico
and a handkerchief to tie about their heads.
They were then led by the man selling them into a large room;
the men placed on one side, the women at the other;
the tallest at the head of each row
and then the next in size
and so on to the shortest.
Many called to look at the slaves for sale
and the seller kept talking about their qualities;
made them hold up their heads and walk about briskly;
and those who might buy had them open their mouths
to look at their teeth,
and felt their arms and bodies,
just as they might a horse for sale;
and asked each what they could do.
Sometimes a man or woman would be taken to a small house
    in the yard,
to be stripped and looked at carefully:
if they had the scars of whips on their backs
that would show they had been troublesome.
During the day a number of sales were made;
and a planter from Baton Rouge bought Eliza’s little son.
Before that the boy had to jump and run across the floor
to show his activity.
But all the time the trade was going on,
his mother was crying and wringing her hands
and kept begging the man who was thinking of buying the boy
not to buy him unless he bought her, too,
and her little daughter:
and Eliza kept saying that if he did she would be “the most
    faithful slave that ever lived.”
But the man from Baton Rouge said he could not afford to
    buy her,
and then she began to cry aloud in her grief.
The man selling the slaves turned on her, his whip lifted,
and told her to stop her noise:
if she would not stop her “sniveling”
he would take her into the yard
and give her a hundred lashes.
She tried to wipe away her tears
but could not
and said she wanted to be with her children
and kept begging the man selling the slaves and the man from
    Baton Rouge—
who by that time had bought her son—
not to separate the three of them, mother, son, and daughter;
and over and over again kept saying how faithful and obedient
    she would be
and how hard she would work day and night.
But the man from Baton Rouge
said again he could not buy mother and son, let alone the three,
and that only the boy must go with him.
Then Eliza ran to her son, hugged him and kissed him
again and again
and her tears kept falling on his face.
The man selling the slaves kept cursing her
and called her a blubbering, howling wench
and ordered her back to her place in line
and to behave herself
or he would give her something really to cry about.

My ancestors weren’t hippies, cotton
precluded fascination with flowers.
I don’t remember communes, I remember
ghettos. The riots were real, not
products of hallucinogens. Free love had
been at Redbones since black unemployment
and credit saturation.
 
The white women my mother cleaned
for didn’t notice she had changed. I guess
it was a small event, a resurrected African
jumping out the gap in her front teeth. I
guess it looked like a cockroach; that’s
what she was supposed to have, not dignity.
 
My mother just couldn’t get excited
about the Beatles, those mops she swilled
in ammonia everyday on their heads. Besides,
she didn’t work like a dog but like a woman;
they aren’t the same. The hair was growing long
for the same reasons Pinocchio’s nose did.
 
I can think only of a lesbian draping
crepe paper chains over my head to make a
black Rapunzel possible; that’s how a white
woman tried to lift my burdens. At the time
I didn’t reject her for being lesbian or
white but for both burdens. That was when
I didn’t want Ivory soap to be what
cleaned me, made me presentable to society.
All the suds I’d seen were white, they still
are but who cares? I’m more interested in
how soap dwindles in my hand, under the faucet.
 
I’m old enough to remember blocks
of ice, old enough or poor enough.
I remember chipping away at it, broken
glass all over the floor. Later in the
riots, the broken glass of looting tattled
how desperate people were to keep cool.
 
There are roses now in my mother’s yard.
Sometimes she cuts them, sets them in Pepsi
bottles throughout her rooms. She is,
I admit, being sentimental. Looting her
heart. My father who planted them is gone.
That mop in the corner
is his cane growing roots.

devotions, their geometry of scent, their cocoons

to point to their noses, hoses and cables and networks,
their tools, if I can use that word now—and scales and
scanners and Glue Rectories.
I wanted you to meet my broom mother
who carved a hole into her womb
so that I could live—
At every sunset she stands
under the shadow of the watchtowers
elongating and denying her breath.
I wanted to look under the rubble fields
for once, for you (if you approved), flee
into the bullet-riddled openness and fall flat,
arched, askew, under the rubble sheets
and let the rubble fill me
with its sharp plates and ripped dust—
alphabets incomplete and humid. You,
listen,
a little closer

a ribbon, agitated by unnamed forces, devoured.

Web-toed she walks into the land, fins
Carving out river bottoms, each hesitation
A lakebed, each mid-afternoon nap, a plateau,
Quaint, at least that is my dream of her,
Big shouldered, out there daydreaming
The world into existence, pleasuring herself
With lines and pauses. How else? What is a lake
But a pause? People circling it with structures, dipping
In their poles? Once she thought she could pass by
Harmless. Scraping wet shale, her knees down in it, she
Tries to remember earth, that ground cover. She tries
To reattach things, but why? What if the world
Is all action? What if thought isn’t glue, but tearing?
She sits at the lake edge where the water never meets
Earth, never touches, not really, is always pulling
Itself on to the next.

She could scoop PCBs from the Hudson, she is
Always picking up after someone. But what? What

Her with a shotgun across his range. Cow pies and
Hornets’ nests, gangly boys shooting cats with BB guns,
Boys summering from Calgary, trees hollowed out,
Hiding all manner of contraband goods. When she peers
In the knotted oak, classic movies run on
The hour, Scout on the dark bark, Mildred
Pierce with a squirrel tale wrap. Nature is over,
She concludes. Nature is what is caught, cellular,
Celluloid. She sticks a thumb in another tree, a
Brownstone, a small girl—her heart a thing locked.
It’s been so long since she felt hopeful. (Perhaps nature
Is childhood.) The morning after Chernobyl
Out there with tiny umbrellas. All those internal
Combustions. This is a country that has accepted death
As an industry, it is not news. She has been warned.
Her ratings sag. She scans her least apocalyptic
Self and sees mariners floating, Ben
Franklin penning daily axioms, glasses lifting
From the river bank, planked skirts on Front,
China-like through the industrious, thinking, traffic
Clogged city, its brick heavy with desire for good.
Memory of meadow, Dickinson an ice pick scratching
Wings in her brain: if you see her standing, if you move
Too quickly, if you locate the centre, if you have other
Opportunities, by all means if you have other opportunities.

Abondoned mine shafts on either side, those

Pass, sun on mud flap, the rest stop
Rock slides, glint of snow, the runaway
Lanes, the grades steep as skyscrapers,

Slicing towns, dividing parks,

On her skateboard and feels the air under
Foot, she shakes out her hair, thinking of California,
Thinking of allergies, thinking of the wreck
Of place: who ever promised more? The iris
With its feigned restraint, the daring tuba,
The horn of shoe, utilitarian, delicate. Such
Useful domesticity, such hopeful electronics.
Once she disappeared by turning sideways.
Now she finds it difficult to reappear. She lifts
The sediment of time to her palm, feels it sift
Between her fingers: bone, bits of event. Aren’t
We all a bit fluish this century? Nothing bearing any
Mark of otherwise. No prescript, nothing a bit of hope
Won’t cure. Such a churn of optimism:
That which consecrates will not kill. Maybe New York?
She fits herself on an easterly course: been done,
Been done, but what better than the well-trodden
Path? Beautiful, beautiful, the seams
Of the rich, their folded linens,
Their soft bags of money. If it ain’t broke
Don’t fix, if it ain’t resistant, don’t
Wince, if it fits like a boot, then boot it.
And so she does.

  LOQUITUR: En Betrans de Born.     Dante Alighieri put this man in hell for that he was a stirrer-up of strife.     Eccovi!     Judge ye!     Have I dug him up again?  The scene is his castle, Altaforte. “Papiols” is his jongleur. “The Leopard,” the device of Richard (Cœur de Lion).                                    IDamn it all! all this our South stinks peace.You whoreson dog, Papiols, come! Let’s to music!I have no life save when the swords clash.But ah! when I see the standards gold, vair, purple, opposingAnd the broad fields beneath them turn crimson,Then howl I my heart nigh mad with rejoicing.                                     IIIn hot summer have I great rejoicingWhen the tempests kill the earth’s foul peace,And the light’nings from black heav’n flash crimson,And the fierce thunders roar me their musicAnd the winds shriek through the clouds mad, opposing,And through all the riven skies God’s swords clash.                                     IIIHell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!And the shrill neighs of destriers in battle rejoicing,Spiked breast to spiked breast opposing!Better one hour’s stour than a year’s peaceWith fat boards, bawds, wine and frail music!Bah! there’s no wine like the blood’s crimson!                                     IVAnd I love to see the sun rise blood-crimson.And I watch his spears through the dark clashAnd it fills all my heart with rejoicingAnd prys wide my mouth with fast musicWhen I see him so scorn and defy peace,His lone might ’gainst all darkness opposing.                                     VThe man who fears war and squats opposingMy words for stour, hath no blood of crimsonBut is fit only to rot in womanish peaceFar from where worth’s won and the swords clashFor the death of such sluts I go rejoicing;Yea, I fill all the air with my music.                                     VIPapiols, Papiols, to the music!There’s no sound like to swords swords opposing,No cry like the battle’s rejoicingWhen our elbows and swords drip the crimsonAnd our charges ’gainst “The Leopard’s” rush clash.May God damn for ever all who cry “Peace!”                                     VIIAnd let the music of the swords make them crimsonHell grant soon we hear again the swords clash!Hell blot black for always the thought “Peace”!

You also, our first great, Had tried all ways; Tested and pried and worked in many fashions, And this much gives me heart to play the game.

You had your searches, your uncertainties, And this is good to know—for us, I mean, Who bear the brunt of our America And try to wrench her impulse into art. You were not always sure, not always set To hiding night or tuning ""symphonies""; Had not one style from birth, but tried and pried And stretched and tampered with the media.

                ","
Dark as the clouds of even, Ranked in the western heaven, Waiting the breath that lifts All the dread mass, and drifts Tempest and falling brand Over a ruined land;— So still and orderly, Arm to arm, knee to knee, Waiting the great event, Stands the Black Regiment.   Down the long dusky line Teeth gleam and eyeballs shine; And the bright bayonet, Bristling and firmly set, Flashed with a purpose grand, Long ere the sharp command Of the fierce rolling drum Told them their time had come, Told them what work was sent For the Black Regiment.   “Now,” the flag-sergeant cried, “Though death and hell betide, Let the whole nation see If we are fit to be Free in this land; or bound Down, like the whining hound,— Bound with red stripes of pain In our old chains again!” Oh, what a shout there went From the Black Regiment!   “Charge!” Trump and drum awoke, Onward the bondmen broke; Bayonet and sabre-stroke Vainly opposed their rush. Through the wild battle’s crush, With but one thought aflush, Driving their lords like chaff, In the guns’ mouths they laugh; Or at the slippery brands Leaping with open hands, Down they tear man and horse, Down in their awful course; Tramping with bloody heel Over the crashing steel, All their eyes forward bent, Rushed the Black Regiment.  “Freedom!” their battle-cry— “Freedom! or leave to die!” Ah! And they meant the word, Not as with us ’tis heard, Not a mere party shout: They gave their spirits out; Trusted the end to God, And on the gory sod Rolled in triumphant blood.  Glad to strike one free blow, Whether for weal or woe; Glad to breathe one free breath, Though on the lips of death. Praying—alas! in vain!— That they might fall again, So they could once more see That burst to liberty! This was what “freedom” lent To this Black Regiment.  Hundreds on hundreds fell; But they are resting well; Scourges and shackles strong Never shall do them wrong.  Oh, to the living few, Soldiers, be just and true! Hail them as comrades tried; Fight with them side by side; Never, in field or tent, Scorn the Black Regiment.

Kubla Ché, dreaming of ancient
Egypt, ate his hyacinths and was
marvelous. Wherever you are is
what I’m meant to say. Before you
beauty come, Dis crouching among
the black basalt, kneading master’s
soured linen, watching (bewatched)
the great beaten gold litter borne by,
deltoids sun-dewed stone, temples
bronze & strong &     in train     in
       thrall perpetual —

cloth-of-gold, the scented, sweating
box she sat in (think box, lock box) — 
Phoenician forest, seeder of  known
world’s every known green: malachite,
sea-green jasper, chrysocolla, olivine —

landed, in rainless, treeless Thebes, my
dark knees tendered by two lands, rubbed
bare by work & love — 
       Move the tombs to the cliffs of
Beni Hasan. Send salt from the four
lakes. She is Nefertiti, she shares
the crown, she brings the single sun.
You do not watch the sun. But in
the Deeds of  Suppiluliuma she
says she is fearful     but there is no
fear past true heresy, her beauty is
clear of the next line & the next and
that kind of  beauty is     if not
redemption the possibility of a
separate resurrection.

Ché, in full mouth: We will be perfect.
There will be a recognition. The skill
has left your fingers, the dream your
brainpan but time, too, is prospected by
work     (the lumen of the vein)     (the
schist afire through the rock) and humans,
too, may burn like candles, their spines
wicks, their feverdreams the sputting
flames — 
       Work in the shadows. We will work
in the shadows, the rest being the
madness. Naughty naughty boy. Ward
residuum. Hold to murmur, hold
to method. You see? Time breaks along
its faults, lays bare its jeweled fragments
for those who love and work. It gives
it all for free. It asks only reversion
at the end. (And like, that end whereof
we could not think     thereof  (no
questions asked) you spake & said, My
father     and you answered, Here am I,
my son)     O tell me — go, you go

deracinates a people to upraise it
with their bowed backs, mortar it with
their warm, oxygenated blood     sunk
generations & contingency &
opportunity cost     gambling our
own lives’ great gamble: that wrong,
actioned by time, can be made
soluble in art.

Listen, I want to say something to you.
You arrived just in time. You told me
they’re not better than us, you honored
our sin, repaired my will, you were
havoc in the trees, the dense infolding
fire & its fuel at once (white fusion,
wild usufruct)     always your mind
was the Emergency, always severaled,
chording the upper & lower, equal
& bonded in appetency, bonded
always to mine.
       This is a moment of children.
Who cares who sees? (Who sees?) We
scoff at faultless entropy, we strip the
pith from the inner stalk, we count to
three. Talk me into it, daddy (the
first rolls were blank)     oxidize
this carbon black significance — heart
of water — this red hematite & blue
frit, these yellow ochres that every
child knows enflesh the unreal
sun — 
 
xi 
Put it another way: the ink gleams
for three more words before it (and
meaning) sets. In those three beats I
must be thousand-faced, entelechied,
liable, I must be totally told on — 
       in the middle of my life
a myth, a tidal mouth, I am planted
in bitter celery, in the phytolithic
matrix     all-possible clay     I sense
your slow impulsion all around me.
       Heart’s lake, calendula on my
fingers, laughter in the morning-
golded reeds (shaking the papyrus),
the scale in the wind that shakes
the reeds, deus absconditus, the only
gossip of the living, I miss you
so much.
 
xii 
Either we are eternal, with neither
end nor beginning, or we are
sprung from a single thing and
proliferative — in either case death
is not death (though time cannot but
give form to suffering). Believe
(if you must) as I must:
       In all things moment.
       In each thing everything.

Riven by its little war

The children play at the Luxembourg fountain.
Their small ships catch wind and sail out and come round again.2
Sometime between 250 and 200 B.C.
fishermen and boatmen of the tribe Parisii
discovered and built their huts on the largest island   
in the River Seine. Celtic Lutetia, “Town surround-
ed by water,”
                     thus was born there.
The island is shaped like a boat—
and this figure became a part
of the capital’s coat-of-arms. So this was the start   
of the City first named for its engulfing water   
(on whose economy it depended), then after
the people themselves: members of the tribe of Paris.   
We listen to these water folk and know they hear us,   
for we are born out of boats and out of water.   
The first sound we hear is the heart
knocking quiet as a boat docks:
and we all dissolve to island, earth and tears later.3
And into air and fire! Once in the Latin Quarter
in a space formed for him by waves of bright loiterers
near the shortest street named for the Cat Who Catches Fish—
or who (with slight inflection) “sins”—
I watched a dark young man, naked to his thin waist, push
long plumes of flame into the air
above our awed faces raised there.
From the sharp heat inside and out,
his head and chest glowed in the night
with an aura of oil or sweat.
Thirsting, he drank again from a sponge of kerosene
and breathed out long strings of fire and smoke into the Street   
of the Harp.
                   Dark ash dropped back upon his face and cap,   
which lay open on the cobbled road waiting for coins   
from all who guessed at the mystery in what he’d done.   
He built a vast pillar of fire as if to guide us,
then suddenly stopped, walked across
the space, and kissed a reaching child
(to bless and heal that amazed head),
waved gratefully to us who now filled his cap with alms,
and, smiling and burned (I saw scars beneath his raised arm),   
he sailed up that narrowing street in a wildly bal-
looning white shirt we had watched him casually don   
to cover his vestment of skin.4
For centuries that old City
ended its west boundary
in a small archipelago
separated from the main island by the Seine’s two
arms. It was on one of these small islets that Philip
the Fair about the year 1314 had raised up
a stake for the grand master, Order of Templars, whom
he condemned, then from the palace window watched him burn.   
These little islands, quickened with their ghost victim’s screams,   
were joined in the sixteenth century by the decree
of Henry Third (and by a great engineering feat
Faust could envy) to the main island of the City.
This new western tip was given the name of a park,
“Vert Galant,” nickname of Henry Fourth: “The Gay old Spark.”
Near there I watched in a loud street
a white-haired man stand with one foot
on the curb, the other in the cobbled street, and play   
an old mandolin. He was dressed in a black and frayed   
tuxedo and played with intense passion, sadly, but   
this desperate, dignified man, transformed by his art   
and by poverty (his case kept open for money),
could not play the mandolin. —He
just strummed the same chord again
                                                    and again and again ...5
It was also Philip the Fair
who created an aristocratic prison air
by building the blocks-long Gothic Conciergerie.
The best view is from the Right Bank: The Slaughter House Quay   
(which now is a market for pets).
You can see the four recently cleaned towers reflect-
ed in the Seine. (At the Seine in fall, beneath the red   
and gold leaves, you see the rust, mahogany and beige   
boats gently jostle together at the shore and wait.)   
On the right: the crenelated Bonbec Tower stays.   
Bonbec means “babbler,” for this place
was used through the centuries as a torture chamber.   
The right one of the twin towers, Argent, held treasure.   
Still the gorgeous Horloge Tower on the left corner
of the ancient building across from the Bridge of Change   
houses the giant clock which gave its name to that quay:   
in its field of blue the many great gold fleurs-de-lys   
and the two life-sized mythical
women, one with a fascicle
of wheat, one with a balanced scale raised high in the clock,   
whose silver chime used to toll the hours for the monarch.   
(This was melted down in those days when Terror struck.)   
In this turreted place we have shaved the graceful neck   
and head of Marie Antoinette, ripped her white, ruffled   
collar wide and wrapped the cuff of
rope about her hands behind her back. We made her face
the casual knitting women and men making fists   
sitting on steps in the “May Court”

Charlotte Corday, poet and brother André Chénier,   
Madame du Barry—all 2600 who died,
having said their last farewells in the Women‘s Courtyard,   
twelve per day underneath the blade!

Was there sometimes an image of beauty in their minds   
at the last? Perhaps on white sands
beside the blue-black sea a matched pair of roan horses   
galloping together in the bright spume, riderless.   
Or a nude young man and woman lying together

forever gnaw on stone rabbits in the parapets

all glory happening within the walls where they squat:
so hunched, so beaked, so horrorstruck.7

rising fifty feet:
                            its spire piercing the foliate,
layered, many-colored egg of the vault of heaven,   
showering all the primal hues and shadows given—
bright as the truth reflected in a drop of fresh blood   
or the colors of the body’s inner organs hid-
den before the sure explosion of light that hits them   
at the moment of violent death. —This is a time
like that of the sun that once a year, just at the dawn   
of winter solstice, lights up an ancient Celtic stone   
grave, striking the bones spread on shelves
with all the colors of the flesh.8
Who can stand these juxtapositions of person and place and time? I walk across the Bridge of Change where I have so often watched by the towers of the Conciergerie. Now, water laves a little higher up the stair from the River to the Quay, hiding some of the steps from me. Boats nudge at the edge. I walk along the Boulevard past the great gold and blue corner clock, the ornate wrought-iron gate and fence of the Place of Justice (its name changed from the time of kings), past the shadow and spire of Sainte Chapelle. I cross the Bridge of Saint Michel into the Latin Quarter. But I do not look for the Street of the Cat Who Fishes or the Street of the Harp. I turn right, wandering a bit, and suddenly, as if by chance, find myself at this street, and here I will wait, for it is our street, Rue Gît le Coeur: Here Lies the Heart.

                ","
Wheal Emma and Brookwood are abandoned copper mines whose remains are located near Buckfastleigh, within the Dartmoor National Park, an area with a long history of widespread industrial activity. From this one locality, in the second half of the nineteenth century, more than thirty thousand tons of copper ore were raised, processed, and shipped for smelting. In 1859, in order to stabilize and increase the power supply, Wheal Emma Leat (a fifteen-mile-long channel) was cut across moorland and around woodland valleys to transport water from the River Swincombe and to feed the mines by supplementing the Mardle, a tributary of the Dart. Some of this now empty moorland waterway can be walked today on Dartmoor. I am grateful to Kevin and Donna Cox, owners of the Brook Manor estate, for showing my collaborator, Ignacio Acosta, and me over the remains of mine workings on their land.

Widening the plug doorway
on the bob wall left no
surface evidence. The Mardle
has a floodplain fair and wide.
Material would have been
trammed directly, although
blacked ochreous water flows
freely from the collapsed
portal. Humphrey kept Kevin
back when we went into
the near horizontal dark adit
stooped at the panic shaft.
In Brook Wood at the combe
head is a small killas quarry
predating all three setts.
Rent was paid to the Brook Wood
adventurers. Three areas of
dumping partially covered
this crumbled masonry within
woodland of varying density
just south of the tarmac road.
Yet a leat is depicted on the
1886 OS map channeled entirely
in a raised wooden aqueduct.

Then buildings fall into decay
where ivy and tree growth
have taken hold. The silted channel
follows the contour round hills
and combes using the best-fit
method to Wheal Emma sett.
Whereas conifer scrub and dense
patches of rhododendron
are seen quite late in the sequence.
All 99 stations were used and
having passed over the wheel
water may have been diverted.
The long wheelhouse sides are not
straight but slightly kinked to provide
for a dished 60-ft wheel
over an arched tailrace exit
at floor level. In this same evening
were those people engaged to feast
on roast beef and strong ale nearby.
Within the valley of the holy brook
the mines are situated near
Buckfastleigh, crushed ores are hauled
for the South Wales copper smelters,
Alfred Jenkin their agent in Cornwall.
Over and over had they been
in the heaven of expectation
finding the ore ground pitched eastward;
those who gambled their lives in swift
currents and dark treacherous pools.
Granting two properties as
one sett at a royalty of 1/24
together with fine machinery,
wheels, a beam engine, and water
privileges. One hundred and twenty-
five workers being then separated
only by a small transverse valley.
The flat rods moved off so quietly
that those not looking were unconscious
of their being in motion. Steam was
employed only at limited scale.
Emma, 116 fathoms below adit,
pumping backed-up water for life itself:
men cutting lode in fume- and dust-ridden air
or crushing with hand tools, spalling, cobbing,
came our tramroad to harbor direct
in Totnes and thence by sea to Neath — 
no more windlass or horse-whim turning.
What you see here is the dressing floor.
Their Phoenician purple dye — 
their copper with fifteen percent
Cornish tin. Remember when
a solid solution of
metal elements was defined
by ecstatic bonding.
Water poured over its surface
producing hydrogen gas.
The new material is
stable and ready for use
but scaled-up production

We love the color and
the stillness. Nothing would
live in this water now
at the base of a spoil heap
two stories high. Worm casts
and broadly scattered pits
are laminated onto a
non-conductive substrate.
This is the green pool:
a water soak away
made from glass epoxy.
They are brown and green
like uneven flat loaves
and the museum label
reads tortas de cobre.
Moss grows on anything
like black flame retardant
mechanically supports and
electrically connects — 
the fenced-off shaft
protecting the river
from what leaches out
between sea-borne traders.
At these horizons the levels were
extended over 330 fathoms.
Small groups of self-employed
miners and their families
continued to migrate. Here was
alluvial gold mixed with
sand and gravel, producing
more than 14 heads of stamps were
capable of crushing. Composed
of quartz, peach, and gossan with black
and yellow copper letting down
a stream of mineralized water.
For in much of this section
the leat had been cut from
solid rock. A stone-lined sluice
is just visible. 4,000 shares
on the cost book system,
streamworks in eluvial ground,
5 shillings each deposit. Nothing
but a washing strake such as
we use, commodified and priced
both minerals since the Bronze Age
in West Devon, in Cornwall
beneath a layer of black sand.
An adit is also brought home
to the spot from below: narrow
tailings in steep profile cast
every shovel full as it rises
into a tye. £40,000 worth
of copper ore from above
the 50-fathom level.
Water breaks up the soil, exposing
mere threads of land, linear strips
cut into channels called races
dug across the ground to be worked,
removing the overburden.

Ye say they all have passed away,    That noble race and brave, That their light canoes have vanished    From off the crested wave; That ’mid the forests where they roamed    There rings no hunter shout, But their name is on your waters,    Ye may not wash it out. ’Tis where Ontario’s billow    Like Ocean’s surge is curled, Where strong Niagara’s thunders wake    The echo of the world. Where red Missouri bringeth    Rich tribute from the west, And Rappahannock sweetly sleeps    On green Virginia’s breast. Ye say their cone-like cabins,    That clustered o’er the vale, Have fled away like withered leaves    Before the autumn gale, But their memory liveth on your hills,    Their baptism on your shore, Your everlasting rivers speak    Their dialect of yore. Old Massachusetts wears it,    Within her lordly crown, And broad Ohio bears it,    Amid his young renown; Connecticut hath wreathed it    Where her quiet foliage waves, And bold Kentucky breathed it hoarse    Through all her ancient caves. Wachuset hides its lingering voice    Within his rocky heart, And Alleghany graves its tone    Throughout his lofty chart; Monadnock on his forehead hoar    Doth seal the sacred trust, Your mountains build their monument,    Though ye destroy their dust. Ye call these red-browned brethren    The insects of an hour, Crushed like the noteless worm amid    The regions of their power; Ye drive them from their father’s lands,    Ye break of faith the seal, But can ye from the court of Heaven     Exclude their last appeal? Ye see their unresisting tribes,    With toilsome step and slow, On through the trackless desert pass    A caravan of woe; Think ye the Eternal’s ear is deaf?    His sleepless vision dim? Think ye the soul’s blood may not cry    From that far land to him?

I was thy neighbour once, thou rugged Pile! Four summer weeks I dwelt in sight of thee: I saw thee every day; and all the while Thy Form was sleeping on a glassy sea. So pure the sky, so quiet was the air! So like, so very like, was day to day! Whene'er I looked, thy Image still was there; It trembled, but it never passed away. How perfect was the calm! it seemed no sleep; No mood, which season takes away, or brings: I could have fancied that the mighty Deep Was even the gentlest of all gentle things. Ah!  then , if mine had been the Painter's hand, To express what then I saw; and add the gleam, The light that never was, on sea or land, The consecration, and the Poet's dream; I would have planted thee, thou hoary Pile Amid a world how different from this! Beside a sea that could not cease to smile; On tranquil land, beneath a sky of bliss. Thou shouldst have seemed a treasure-house divine Of peaceful years; a chronicle of heaven;— Of all the sunbeams that did ever shine The very sweetest had to thee been given. A Picture had it been of lasting ease, Elysian quiet, without toil or strife; No motion but the moving tide, a breeze, Or merely silent Nature's breathing life. Such, in the fond illusion of my heart, Such Picture would I at that time have made: And seen the soul of truth in every part, A steadfast peace that might not be betrayed. So once it would have been,—'tis so no more; I have submitted to a new control: A power is gone, which nothing can restore; A deep distress hath humanised my Soul. Not for a moment could I now behold A smiling sea, and be what I have been: The feeling of my loss will ne'er be old; This, which I know, I speak with mind serene. Then, Beaumont, Friend! who would have been the Friend, If he had lived, of Him whom I deplore, This work of thine I blame not, but commend; This sea in anger, and that dismal shore. O 'tis a passionate Work!—yet wise and well, Well chosen is the spirit that is here; That Hulk which labours in the deadly swell, This rueful sky, this pageantry of fear! And this huge Castle, standing here sublime, I love to see the look with which it braves, Cased in the unfeeling armour of old time, The lightning, the fierce wind, the trampling waves. Farewell, farewell the heart that lives alone, Housed in a dream, at distance from the Kind! Such happiness, wherever it be known, Is to be pitied; for 'tis surely blind. But welcome fortitude, and patient cheer, And frequent sights of what is to be borne! Such sights, or worse, as are before me here.— Not without hope we suffer and we mourn.

THYRSIS Do not sigh, fair nymph, for fire Hath no wings yet doth aspire Till it hit against the Pole: Heaven’s the centre of the soul. DORINDA But in Elysium how do they Pass eternity away? THYRSIS Oh, there’s neither hope nor fear, There’s no wolf, no fox, no bear. No need of dog to fetch our stray, Our Lightfoot we may give away; No oat-pipe’s needful; there thy ears May sleep with music of the spheres. DORINDA Oh sweet! Oh sweet! How I my future state By silent thinking antedate: I prithee let us spend our time to come In talking of Elysium. THYRSIS Then I’ll go on. There sheep are full Of sweetest grass and softest wool; There birds sing consorts, garlands grow, Cool winds do whisper, springs do flow. There always is a rising sun, And day is ever but begun. Shepherds there bear equal sway, And every nymph’s a Queen of May. DORINDA Ah me, ah me! THYRSIS                         Dorinda, why dost cry? DORINDA I’m sick, I’m sick, and fain would die. Convince me now that this is true By bidding with me all adieu. THYRSIS I cannot live without thee, I, I’ll for thee, much more with thee, die. CHORUS Then let us give Corillo charge o’ the sheep, And thou and I’ll pick poppies, and them steep In wine, and drink on’t even till we weep, So shall we smoothly pass away in sleep.

For we shall cross many hills yet
Before we grow old; here

I look out the bars upon the Castle
    the crust caked row of age
    in a corner my friendly spider
    crouches for the unwary gnats
    of my days.
    So much there is we must atone.
There are spires of faith
in the invisible claws of spiders
in the flight and curve of gulls.
These know, I swear,
    the contours of the rolling Saharas
    and the destitute oceans of our history.
We sit, debating the charity of our captors.
At night lights come on
the shoreline bends into a broad bay
    near the Castle
    the sea is gray
Yesterday it rained on the eve
    of my forty-first year
        and left all my defeats intact
Let me lead you into the country
It is only as half clansman
        of the ritual goat    
that I bring my song to the place of sacrifice
here in the pain fields
        asphalt and smoke of a large hearth
I lead
my rope is short.
        I shall soon arrive under the tree.
I will stage a hundred fights in honor of our Gods
and our beloved leader
Here, I could care less for the toiling masses
I retreated here before Lent
to my own stretch of sea front
(I cannot see the damned sea
        because of old caked walls
        built by Dutchmen)
But the shore falls into a deep gulf
        there are no cliffs.
They found a week-old baby
buried in a shallow grave
on the front lawn of the fort.
I want my grave to be deeper.
They are sawing through our firewood
    Today is cassava day
The flutist is silent
Perhaps his troops have arrived in Georgia
Not to arrive upsets me
And for the path that I have trod
    I have no regrets

 I will do everything you tell me, Mother. I will charm three gold hairs from the demon’s head. I will choke the mouse that gnaws an apple tree’s roots and keep its skin for a glove. To the wolf, I will be pretty and kind and curtsy his crossing of my path.   The forest, vocal   even in its somber tread, rages. A slope ends in a pit of foxes drunk on rotten brambles of berries and the raccoons ransack a rabbit’s unmasked hole. What do they find but a winter’s heap of droppings? A stolen nest, the cracked shell   of another creature’s child.   I imagine this is the rabbit way and I will not stray, Mother, into the forest’s thick, where the trees meet the dark, though I have known misgivings of light as a hot hand that flickers against my neck. The path ends   at a river I must cross. I will wait   for the ferryman to motion me through. Into the waves he etches with his oar a new story: a silent girl runs away, a silent girl is never safe. I will take his oar in my hand. I will learn the boat’s rocking and bring myself back   and forth. To be good   is the hurricane of caution. I will know indecision’s rowing, the water I lap into my lap as he shakes his withered head. Behind me is the forest. Before me the field, a loose run of grass. I stay in the river, Mother, I study escape.

Doors opened and shut,  the director shouted orders  through a bullhorn,  or babbled just                                out of the frame.  A carpenter hammered flats nearby  for the next production.  All of this, and more,  while the actors blocked it out,  already living  in that small square of light  where silence reigned  like a tiny theatre for the deaf.  Now, almost a century later,  it's peaceful, far  from the center of action,  the last voice on the street  reduced to a whisper,                                then gone.  Not even birdsong  as evening's opening credits  begin to roll.  Only the film,  shimmering out of a disc  thinner than sound,  characters moving  like fish in their gray element—  less than fish—  not a hiss, not a bubble,  not even a cry  from that dim world of silence  doubled by time.

Late cranes with heavy wing, and lazy flight,
Sail up the silence with the nearing night.

Bedfordshire
A blue bird showing off its undercarriage
En route between our oldest universities
Was observed slightly off-course above Woburn
In the leafy heart of our sleepiest county:
Two cyclists in tandem looked up at the same moment,
Like a busy footnote to its asterisk.
   Berkshire
Once on the causeway outside Steventon
I had a vision of living in willing exile,
Of living the knowingly imperfect life
But with a boundless and joyous energy
Like Borodin played by the North Berkshire
Youth Orchestra in its early days.
   Buckinghamshire
A goose in the garden of the second-best pub
In Marsh Gibbon was busy doing its dirty toothpaste
And noisy, too, when a woman staggered out
Of the lounge bar into the deserted car-park
Saying: ‘I could never think of the child at my breast
As anything other than a penis with a mouth.’
   Cambridgeshire
The bird arrived. Nothing so stately-exciting
As Handel’s dusky queen that was unspooling
Perhaps too loudly from a scribbling student cell,
But looped between the trees, a flash of green:
And only the having chanced to look just there
Could tell you it had ever been away.
   Cheshire
There was a young woman of Cheadle, who wore her heart
Upon her sleeve, bright chevron! Oh, the keen-eyed
Men of Cheadle, as in the jealous month
When the registration numbers of new estate cars
Change all over wealthy suburban Cheshire,
And they picked out her heart with a needle.
   Cornwall
The very last cat to speak Cornish had a glass eye
And kept a corner shop, selling shoe-laces and bullseyes,
Brasso and Reckitt’s Blue. My great-aunt remembers
Buying postcards from him as a girl,
When George’s profile sped them for a penny.
Aching to talk, he died of pure loneliness.
   Cumberland
They play bezique in Threlkeld and they play
For keeps in Shap. And all the shapely clouds
Roll through the streets like weeping chemistry
Or cows escaped. And tea is served in the lounge
Over a jig-saw puzzle of the Princess Elizabeth
Beneath wet panes, wet mountains and wet sky.
   Derbyshire
Once upon a time, in Derbyshire’s leaking basement
Where you lie back in boats and quant by walking the ceiling,
A strange girl in the dripping darkness attached
Her damp lips to mine fast, like a snail’s adherence
To cold stone in dusty nettles, and all unseeen
The bluejohn slid by me: yellows, greys and purples.
   Devon
You will never forget the fish market at Barnstaple:
Wet gills, double bellies, gleaming scales,
Shells like spilt treasure. And the cream there thicker
Than a virgin’s dream, and Devon’s greatest poet
Born Gay, on Joy Street, taught by Robert Luck:
It is the paradise of all fat poets.
   Dorset
When the old woman entered the sea at Charmouth
And the great waves hung over her head like theatre curtains,
I thought of the sibyl who charmed the rocks to yield
Their grainy secrets till history bore down
Upon her and the liquid world was fixed
For ever in the era of the fossils.
   Durham
At the end of your battered philosophical quest,
The purity of Durham rises like an exhalation,
Like the stench of sulphur in a barrel. Birds
Build in the walls of the cloisters, disappearing into holes
Like black-robed devotees. Inside it is quiet,
The oatmeal crimping distant in grey air.
   Essex
I had a vision in the dead of night
Of all the kitchens of commuters’ Essex
Alight like the heads of snakes; and down them slid
The bored wives and daughters of the managers
Who were at the identical time arriving
On the ladders of their power and fatigue.
   Gloucestershire
Armorial memorials reduced
To leper stone, forests to hedges, hedges
To sickled stumps where perch the songless birds
Of Gloucestershire, and vans require the roads
Before them in their headlights. No one speaks
In the time it takes to cross the greenest county.
   Hampshire
Driving at evening down the A 34
Like a ski-run, the sun a deiphany,
The car-radio a percussive Russian insistence:
Pure pleasure, pure escape! Past Winchester,
Unseen its stalking scholars, past everything,
Driving through Hampshire, driving for the boats!
   Herefordshire
Alone between the Arrow and the Wye,
Wales to the west, keeping its rain and secrets,
I wandered in cider country, where the shade
Beneath the trees is golden red and noisy
With the jealous spite of wasps: Ariconium,
The poet Philips, his long hair combed out!
   Hertfordshire
Hertfordshire is full of schoolmasters,
And archaeologists who are part-time poets.
Together they apportion past, present
And future among their imaginary admirers
In the form of examination papers, foul
Drafts, and labels of dubious information.
   Huntingdonshire
Herds of deer are moving through the trees
Of Huntingdonshire noisily and rather
Slowly. An idle hand sweeping the lyre
Brings tears to the eyes of the moderately rich.
They will dip their hands in their pockets, gently dip
But not too deep. You’ve got to keep money moving.
   Kent
Old men coming up to bowl remember
Other old men who in their turn remembered
Things that were hardly worth remembering
Through long still nights in Ashford, Faversham,
Sevenoaks and Tunbridge Wells and Westerham
Where even now the fields still smell of beer.
   Lancashire
All the oven doors of Lancashire
Swing open on the hour, revealing vast
Puddings. After tea, the lovers stroll,
Their hands in each other’s back trouser pockets,
Feeling the strange swell of the flexing buttock.
The sun sinks, and the Ribble runs to the sea.
   Leicestershire
Cheeks of angels, lips compressed, donate
To brass invisible impulsions of
Purely material breath: a county’s children
Gather to create an overture,
While brothers and fathers leaping over hedges
Wind horns to their alternative conclusion.
   Lincolnshire
M1, M18, M180: the roads
With their bright and bowline intersections sweep
North to Scunthorpe. Go further if you will
To where the Trent meets the Humber and Lincolnshire ends.
There, at Alkborough, you may draw breath
And if Nicky’s at home she will give you a cup of something.
   Middlesex
Middlesex is mostly roundabouts, the bright
Voice of five p.m., insistent infotainment:
Fingers gallop irritably on the steering-wheel;
The nails make little clicks. Down the line
Of fuming stationary Volvos boys bully with headlines
That tell the drivers all about the place they have come from.
   Norfolk
Norfolk is somehow inverted: it’s all sky
With clouds as bulky as castrati or lines of Dryden
Sailing out above you, tinged with sunset.
Get as far as you can, but not too far,
Say to the Tuesday Market Place at King’s Lynn
Where all the conveyancing is done in verse.
   Northamptonshire
Once half-lost here, when only a map of sounds
Or smells could lead us from a wood, we came
At evening to horse-brass and low-timbered beams
Where the world had evolved to its great public state
And the men and women of Northampton, being counted
And with amber drinks, found themselves to be happy.
   Northumberland
Traitors’ county: from one end to the other
You can walk bright-eyed with never a second glance
From a stocky frowning people who move slowly
And mind their own business. For they have seen it all:
When the mist clears over Northumberland
It leaves squat towers, valleys scarred with lead.
   Nottinghamshire
There is one red door in one slightly curved
Street in one nameless market town
That contains behind it for a moment an image
Of the planet’s destiny: a girl stooping
To a hallway mirror, making her lips move
Into a theatrical kiss, a self kiss.
   Oxfordshire
The kingfisher has long flown. Along the Cherwell
The biscuit of bridge and college wall is blank
Of its image, but with a passing presence
Like a photograph taken with an open shutter.
This, we reflect, is just the sense of our life,
Aware of something the very moment that we miss it.
   Rutland
Rutland is large enough for you and me
To stumble into as into a wood without being seen,
To tread its moss-starred carpet, enchanted
By the chipped china of the russulas,
Pink, grey, grey and green-grey, and red,
Peeping beneath the oaks, not far from Oakham.
   Shropshire
Shropshire Blue, still made, the Lord be praised,
Tart veins that kept the Romans here and Housman
From the rope. The iron bridges lead you to it,
Farms knee-deep in cow. And if you stop off
In red-earthed Bridgnorth, that vigilant town,
Be sure your pint is not ungraced with cheese.
   Somerset
A thousand airy harps! We hardly dare
To let out breath, for our imagination
Responds to these full-throated sounds as though
To the ranks of the ever-delighting dead, our wise
Visionaries, and this is the county of dreams
And of the moon’s occult praesidium.
   Staffordshire
Staffordshire is where you almost came from,
Darkened beneath burnt clay, perpetual dusk.
It is the housewife’s dream, twinkling hearths
Bright with Zebo, scrubbed pumice steps
And, in the bathroom, a finger on the nozzle
And little lavender farts to begin the day.
   Suffolk
I’ve had Leigh and buried St Edmunds,
Stowed Felix and Market and Upland,
I’ve been shut up in Boxton, found it painful in Akenham
And felt totally stupid in Assingham:
Carrying around one’s valuable despair like a fleece,
To live in Suffolk is to suffocate.
   Surrey
Flying in perfect formation above the sleeping
Cul-de-sacs of Surrey, you observe
The blocked pairing of houses, each with a garage,
Like epaulettes. What whisperings behind
The party walls! What eavesdropping, and what
Bad timing! Well done! Sorry, partner! Boom!
   Sussex
Chalk pie, a quality of sun like laughter,
Distance predicted in hoof-beats: everywhere here
Is vigilance as well as cruel amusement,
That tempered island quality called sardonic.
From Rye to Selsey Bill, something is on offer,
A glittering spread, the bottom drawer pulled out.
   Warwickshire
Driving to Wales I crossed a corner of Warwickshire
That seemed to be hardly space at all, the home
Of Dr Hall and his famous father-in-law
Or of magic woods where lovers were lost and found,
But simply the minutes that it took to tell
An unimportant story, now forgotten.
   Westmorland
Once again the skies are open over the whole county:
From Clifton to Burton, from Grasmere to Brough,
The pubtalk steaming with anoraks and orange parkas.
But I can remember one solitary eye
Raging in silence in the dripping marsh,
Its dewy lashes spooning aphids from the air.
   Wiltshire
In Wiltshire they are sending extra-terrestrial
Signals: what will the Venusians think of us?
Four-footed creatures who like to move in circles?
Let’s hope they never noisily discover
That we are only half the men they thought us,
Stumbling at tangents from our glimpsed perfection.
   Worcestershire
Oh darling, come to Broadway: there we’ll take
Tea and scones and jam made from the plums
Of Pershore, perfect, pitless, palate-pleasing.
A stroll in the model street, a browse at Gavina’s.
Then it’s right foot down in the Volvo, plenty of Scotch
And the largest bed we can find at the Bull in Worcester.
   Yorkshire
The brown teapot is always warming here
For there will be a time when you must come home
Though you be unknown except to the flowered dead.
On the moors the diagonal smoke rises
Like a bitter smile, tight but welcoming:
Cousin country, extra places for tea.

crakes, nightingales, storks—this space

across a notebook page. He seems, like me,
honey-slowed by winter's shortest days, clumsy
and isolated. My love bought a black-and-white
photo once, close-up of a birch trunk,
fly crawling up
the curled paper bark, marring the purity

                    The Village: Book I
                ","
The village life, and every care that reignsO'er youthful peasants and declining swains;What labour yields, and what, that labour past,Age, in its hour of languor, finds at last;What forms the real picture of the poor,Demands a song—the Muse can give no more.Fled are those times, if e'er such times were seen, When rustic poets praised their native green;No shepherds now, in smooth alternate verse,Their country's beauty or their nymphs' rehearse;Yet still for these we frame the tender strain,Still in our lays fond Corydons complain,And shepherds' boys their amorous pains reveal,The only pains, alas! they never feel.
 On Mincio's banks, in Caesar's bounteous reign,If Tityrus found the Golden Age again,Must sleepy bards the flattering dream prolong,Mechanic echoes of the Mantuan song?From truth and nature shall we widely stray,Where Virgil, not where Fancy, leads the way?
 Yes, thus the Muses sing of happy swains,Because the Muses never knew their pains.They boast their peasants' pipes, but peasants nowResign their pipes and plod behind the plough;And few amid the rural tribe have timeTo number syllables and play with rhyme;Save honest Duck, what son of verse could shareThe poet's rapture and the peasant's care?Or the great labours of the field degradeWith the new peril of a poorer trade?
 From one chief cause these idle praises spring,That themes so easy few forbear to sing;They ask no thought, require no deep design,But swell the song and liquefy the line;The gentle lover takes the rural strain,A nymph his mistress and himself a swain;With no sad scenes he clouds his tuneful prayer,But all, to look like her, is painted fair.I grant indeed that fields and flocks have charmsFor him that gazes or for him that farms;But when amid such pleasing scenes I traceThe poor laborious natives of the place,And see the mid-day sun, with fervid ray,On their bare heads and dewy temples play;While some, with feebler heads and fainter hearts,Deplore their fortune, yet sustain their parts:Then shall I dare these real ills to hideIn tinsel trappings of poetic pride?
 No, cast by Fortune on a frowning coast,Which can no groves nor happy valleys boast;Where other cares than those the Muse relates,And other shepherds dwell with other mates;By such examples taught, I paint the cot,As truth will paint it, and as bards will not:Nor you, ye poor, of lettered scorn complain,To you the smoothest song is smooth in vain;O'ercome by labour and bowed down by time,Feel you the barren flattery of a rhyme?Can poets soothe you, when you pine for bread,By winding myrtles round your ruined shed?Can their light tales your weighty griefs o'erpower,Or glad with airy mirth the toilsome hour?
 Lo! where the heath, with withering brake grown o'er,Lends the light turf that warms the neighboring poor;From thence a length of burning sand appears,Where the thin harvest waves its withered ears;Rank weeds, that every art and care defy,Reign o'er the land and rob the blighted rye:There thistles stretch their prickly arms afar,And to the ragged infant threaten war;There poppies, nodding, mock the hope of toil,There the blue bugloss paints the sterile soil;Hardy and high, above the slender sheaf,The slimy mallow waves her silky leaf;O'er the young shoot the charlock throws a shade,And the wild tare clings round the sickly blade;With mingled tints the rocky coasts abound,And a sad splendor vainly shines around.
 So looks the nymph whom wretched arts adorn,Betrayed by man, then left for man to scorn;Whose cheek in vain assumes the mimic roseWhile her sad eyes the troubled breast disclose;Whose outward splendour is but folly's dress,Exposing most, when most it gilds distress.
 Here joyless roam a wild amphibious race,With sullen woe displayed in every face;Who far from civil arts and social fly,And scowl at strangers with suspicious eye.
 Here too the lawless merchant of the mainDraws from his plough th' intoxicated swain;Want only claimed the labor of the day,But vice now steals his nightly rest away.
 Where are the swains, who, daily labor done,With rural games played down the setting sun;Who struck with matchless force the bounding ball,Or made the pond'rous quoit obliquely fall;While some huge Ajax, terrible and strong,Engaged some artful stripling of the throng,And, foiled, beneath the young Ulysses fell,When peals of praise the merry mischief tell?Where now are these?—Beneath yon cliff they stand,To show the freighted pinnace where to land;To load the ready steed with guilty haste;To fly in terror o'er the pathless waste,Or, when detected in their straggling course,To foil their foes by cunning or by force;Or, yielding part (when equal knaves contest),To gain a lawless passport for the rest.
 Here, wand'ring long amid these frowning fields,I sought the simple life that Nature yields;Rapine and Wrong and Fear usurped her place,And a bold, artful, surly, savage race;Who, only skilled to take the finny tribe,The yearly dinner, or septennial bribeWait on the shore and, as the waves run high,On the tossed vessel bend their eager eye,Which to their coast directs its vent'rous way,Theirs, or the ocean's, miserable prey.
 As on their neighbouring beach yon swallows stand,And wait for favoring winds to leave the land;While still for flight the ready wing is spread:So waited I the favouring hour, and fled;Fled from these shores where guilt and famine reign,And cried, Ah! hapless they who still remain;Who still remain to hear the ocean roar,Whose greedy waves devour the lessening shore;Till some fierce tide, with more imperious sway,Sweeps the low hut and all it holds away;When the sad tenant weeps from door to door,And begs a poor protection from the poor!
 But these are scenes where Nature's niggard handGave a spare portion to the famished land;Hers is the fault, if here mankind complainOf fruitless toil and labor spent in vain;But yet in other scenes, more fair in view,Where Plenty smiles—alas! she smiles for fewAnd those who taste not, yet behold her store,Are as the slaves that dig the golden ore,The wealth around them makes them doubly poor.Or will you deem them amply paid in health,Labor's fair child, that languishes with wealth?Go then! and see them rising with the sun,Through a long course of daily toil to run;Like him to make the plenteous harvest grow,And yet not shard the plenty they bestow;See them beneath the dog-star's raging heat,When the knees tremble and the temples beat;Behold them, leaning on their scythes, look o'erThe labour past, and toils to come explore;See them alternate suns and showers engage,And hoard up aches and anguish for their age;Through fens and marshy moors their steps pursue,When their warm pores imbibe the evening dew;Then own that labour may as fatal beTo these thy slaves, as luxury to thee.
 Amid this tribe too oft a manly prideStrives in strong toil the fainting heart to hide;There may you see the youth of slender frameContend with weakness, weariness, and shame:Yet urged along, and proudly loth to yield,He strives to join his fellows of the field;Till long-contending nature droops at last,Declining health rejects his poor repast,His cheerless spouse the coming danger sees,And mutual murmurs urge the slow disease.Yet grant them health, 'tis not for us to tell,Though the head droops not, that the heart is well;Or will you urge their homely, plenteous fare,Healthy and plain and still the poor man's share!Oh! trifle not with wants you cannot feel,Nor mock the misery of a stinted meal;Homely not wholesome, plain not plenteous, suchAs you who envy would disdain to touch.
 Ye gentle souls, who dream of rural ease,Whom the smooth stream and smoother sonnet please;Go! if the peaceful cot your praises share,Go, look within, and ask if peace be there:If peace be his—that drooping weary sire,Or theirs, that offspring round their feeble fire,Or hers, that matron pale, whose trembling handTurns on the wretched hearth th' expiring brand.Nor yet can time itself obtain for theseLife's latest comforts, due respect and ease;For yonder see that hoary swain, whose ageCan with no cares except his own engage;Who, propped on that rude staff, looks up to seeThe bare arms broken from the withering tree,On which, a boy, he climbed the loftiest bough,Then his first joy, but his sad emblem now.
 He once was chief in all the rustic trade,His steady hand the straightest furrow made;Full many a prize he won, and still is proudTo find the triumphs of his youth allowed.A transient pleasure sparkles in his eyes,He hears and smiles, then thinks again and sighs:For now he journeys to his grave in pain;The rich disdain him, nay, the poor disdain;Alternate masters now their slave command,And urge the efforts of his feeble hand;Who, when his age attempts its task in vain,With ruthless taunts of lazy poor complain.
 Oft may you see him, when he tends the sheep,His winter-charge, beneath the hillock weep;Oft hear him murmur to the winds that blowO'er his white locks and bury them in snow;When, roused by rage and muttering in the morn,He mends the broken hedge with icy thorn:
 ""Why do I live, when I desire to beAt once from life and life's long labour free?Like leaves in spring, the young are blown away,Without the sorrows of a slow decay;I, like yon withered leaf, remain behind,Nipped by the frost, and shivering in the wind;There it abides till younger buds come on,As I, now all my fellow-swains are gone;Then, from the rising generation thrust,It falls, like me, unnoticed to the dust.
 ""These fruitful fields, these numerous flocks I see,Are others' gain, but killing cares to me;To me the children of my youth are lords,Slow in their gifts but hasty in their words:Wants of their own demand their care, and whoFeels his own want and succors others too?A lonely, wretched man, in pain I go,None need my help and none relieve my woe;Then let my bones beneath the turf be laid,And men forget the wretch they would not aid.""
 Thus groan the old, till, by disease oppressed,They taste a final woe, and then they rest.Theirs is yon house that holds the parish poor,Whose walls of mud scarce bear the broken door;There, where the putrid vapours, flagging, play,And the dull wheel hums doleful through the day;There children dwell, who know no parents' care,Parents, who know no children's love, dwell there;Heart-broken matrons on their joyless bed,Forsaken wives, and mothers never wed;Dejected widows with unheeded tears,And crippled age with more than childhood-fears;The lame, the blind, and, far the happiest they!The moping idiot and the madman gay.
 Here too the sick their final doom receive,Here brought, amid the scenes of grief, to grieve,Where the loud groans from some sad chamber flow,Mixed with the clamors of the crowd below;Here, sorrowing, they each kindred sorrow scan,And the cold charities of man to man:Whose laws indeed for ruined age provide,And strong compulsion plucks the scrap from pride;But still that scrap is bought with many a sigh,And pride embitters what it can't deny.
 Say ye, oppressed by some fantastic woes,Some jarring nerve that baffles your repose;Who press the downy couch, while slaves advanceWith timid eye to read the distant glance;Who with sad prayers the weary doctor teaseTo name the nameless ever-new disease;Who with mock patience dire complaints endure,Which real pain, and that alone, can cure;How would ye bear in real pain to lie,Despised, neglected, left alone to die?How would ye bear to draw your latest breath,Where all that's wretched paves the way for death?
 Such is that room which one rude beam divides,And naked rafters form the sloping sides;Where the vile bands that bind the thatch are seen,And lath and mud is all that lie between;Save one dull pane, that, coarsely patched, gives wayTo the rude tempest, yet excludes the day.Here, on a matted flock, with dust o'erspread,The drooping wretch reclines his languid head;For him no hand the cordial cup applies,Nor wipes the tear that stagnates in his eyes;No friends with soft discourse his pain beguile,Nor promise hope till sickness wears a smile.
 But soon a loud and hasty summons calls,Shakes the thin roof, and echoes round the walls.Anon, a figure enters, quaintly neat,All pride and business, bustle and conceit;With looks unaltered by these scenes of woe,With speed that, entering, speaks his haste to go,He bids the gazing throng around him fly,And carries fate and physic in his eye;A potent quack, long versed in human ills,Who first insults the victim whom he kills;Whose murd'rous hand a drowsy bench protect,And whose most tender mercy is neglect.
 Paid by the parish for attendance here,He wears contempt upon his sapient sneer;In haste he seeks the bed where misery lies,Impatience marked in his averted eyes;And, some habitual queries hurried o'er,Without reply, he rushes on the door:His drooping patient, long inured to pain,And long unheeded, knows remonstrance vain;He ceases now the feeble help to craveOf man, and mutely hastens to the grave.
 But ere his death some pious doubts arise,Some simple fears, which ""bold bad"" men despise;Fain would he ask the parish priest to proveHis title certain to the joys above;For this he sends the murmuring nurse, who callsThe holy stranger to these dismal walls;And doth not he, the pious man, appear,He, ""passing rich with forty pounds a year""?Ah! no; a shepherd of a different stock,And far unlike him, feeds this little flock:A jovial youth, who thinks his Sunday's taskAs much as God or man can fairly ask;The rest he gives to loves and labors light,To fields the morning and to feasts the night;None better skilled the noisy pack to guide,To urge their chase, to cheer them or to chide;Sure in his shot, his game he seldom missed,And seldom failed to win his game at whist;Then, while such honors bloom around his head,Shall he sit sadly by the sick man's bedTo raise the hope he feels not, or with zealTo combat fears that ev'n the pious feel
 Now once again the gloomy scene explore,Less gloomy now; the bitter hour is o'er,The man of many sorrows sighs no more.
 Up yonder hill, behold how sadly slowThe bier moves winding from the vale below;There lie the happy dead, from trouble free,And the glad parish pays the frugal fee.No more, oh Death! thy victim starts to hearChurchwarden stern, or kingly overseer;No more the farmer gets his humble bow,Thou art his lord, the best of tyrants thou!
 Now to the church behold the mourners come,Sedately torpid and devoutly dumb;The village children now their games suspend,To see the bier that bears their ancient friend:For he was one in all their idle sport,And like a monarch ruled their little court;The pliant bow he formed, the flying ball,The bat, the wicket, were his labours all;Him now they follow to his grave, and standSilent and sad, and gazing, hand in hand;While bending low, their eager eyes exploreThe mingled relics of the parish poor.The bell tolls late, the moping owl flies round,Fear marks the flight and magnifies the sound;The busy priest, detained by weightier care,Defers his duty till the day of prayer;And, waiting long, the crowd retire distressed,To think a poor man's bones should lie unblessed.

Hence vain deluding Joys,       The brood of Folly without father bred, How little you bested,       Or fill the fixed mind with all your toys; Dwell in some idle brain,       And fancies fond with gaudy shapes possess, As thick and numberless       As the gay motes that people the sunbeams, Or likest hovering dreams,       The fickle pensioners of Morpheus' train. But hail thou goddess, sage and holy, Hail divinest Melancholy, Whose saintly visage is too bright To hit the sense of human sight; And therefore to our weaker view, O'er-laid with black, staid Wisdom's hue; Black, but such as in esteem, Prince Memnon's sister might beseem, Or that starr'd Ethiop queen that strove To set her beauty's praise above The sea nymphs, and their powers offended. Yet thou art higher far descended, Thee bright-hair'd Vesta long of yore, To solitary Saturn bore; His daughter she (in Saturn's reign, Such mixture was not held a stain) Oft in glimmering bow'rs and glades He met her, and in secret shades Of woody Ida's inmost grove, While yet there was no fear of Jove. Come pensive nun, devout and pure, Sober, stedfast, and demure, All in a robe of darkest grain, Flowing with majestic train, And sable stole of cypress lawn, Over thy decent shoulders drawn. Come, but keep thy wonted state, With ev'n step, and musing gait, And looks commercing with the skies, Thy rapt soul sitting in thine eyes: There held in holy passion still, Forget thyself to marble, till With a sad leaden downward cast, Thou fix them on the earth as fast. And join with thee calm Peace, and Quiet, Spare Fast, that oft with gods doth diet, And hears the Muses in a ring, Aye round about Jove's altar sing. And add to these retired Leisure, That in trim gardens takes his pleasure; But first, and chiefest, with thee bring Him that yon soars on golden wing, Guiding the fiery-wheeled throne, The cherub Contemplation; And the mute Silence hist along, 'Less Philomel will deign a song, In her sweetest, saddest plight, Smoothing the rugged brow of night, While Cynthia checks her dragon yoke, Gently o'er th' accustom'd oak. Sweet bird that shunn'st the noise of folly, Most musical, most melancholy! Thee, chauntress, oft the woods among, I woo to hear thy even-song; And missing thee, I walk unseen On the dry smooth-shaven green, To behold the wand'ring Moon, Riding near her highest noon, Like one that had been led astray Through the heav'ns wide pathless way; And oft, as if her head she bow'd, Stooping through a fleecy cloud. Oft on a plat of rising ground, I hear the far-off curfew sound, Over some wide-water'd shore, Swinging slow with sullen roar; Or if the air will not permit, Some still removed place will fit, Where glowing embers through the room Teach light to counterfeit a gloom, Far from all resort of mirth, Save the cricket on the hearth, Or the bellman's drowsy charm, To bless the doors from nightly harm. Or let my lamp at midnight hour, Be seen in some high lonely tow'r, Where I may oft out-watch the Bear, With thrice great Hermes, or unsphere The spirit of Plato, to unfold What worlds, or what vast regions hold The immortal mind that hath forsook Her mansion in this fleshly nook: And of those dæmons that are found In fire, air, flood, or under ground, Whose power hath a true consent With planet, or with element. Sometime let gorgeous Tragedy In sceptr'd pall come sweeping by, Presenting Thebes', or Pelop's line, Or the tale of Troy divine, Or what (though rare) of later age, Ennobled hath the buskin'd stage. But, O sad Virgin, that thy power Might raise Musæus from his bower, Or bid the soul of Orpheus sing Such notes as, warbled to the string, Drew iron tears down Pluto's cheek, And made Hell grant what love did seek. Or call up him that left half told The story of Cambuscan bold, Of Camball, and of Algarsife, And who had Canace to wife, That own'd the virtuous ring and glass, And of the wond'rous horse of brass, On which the Tartar king did ride; And if aught else, great bards beside, In sage and solemn tunes have sung, Of tourneys and of trophies hung, Of forests, and enchantments drear, Where more is meant than meets the ear. Thus, Night, oft see me in thy pale career, Till civil-suited Morn appear, Not trick'd and frounc'd as she was wont, With the Attic boy to hunt, But kerchief'd in a comely cloud, While rocking winds are piping loud, Or usher'd with a shower still, When the gust hath blown his fill, Ending on the rustling leaves, With minute-drops from off the eaves. And when the Sun begins to fling His flaring beams, me, goddess, bring To arched walks of twilight groves, And shadows brown that Sylvan loves, Of pine, or monumental oak, Where the rude axe with heaved stroke, Was never heard the nymphs to daunt, Or fright them from their hallow'd haunt. There in close covert by some brook, Where no profaner eye may look, Hide me from Day's garish eye, While the bee with honied thigh, That at her flow'ry work doth sing, And the waters murmuring With such consort as they keep, Entice the dewy-feather'd sleep; And let some strange mysterious dream, Wave at his wings, in airy stream Of lively portraiture display'd, Softly on my eye-lids laid. And as I wake, sweet music breathe Above, about, or underneath, Sent by some spirit to mortals good, Or th' unseen Genius of the wood.          But let my due feet never fail To walk the studious cloister's pale, And love the high embowed roof, With antique pillars massy proof, And storied windows richly dight, Casting a dim religious light. There let the pealing organ blow, To the full-voic'd quire below, In service high, and anthems clear, As may with sweetness, through mine ear, Dissolve me into ecstasies, And bring all Heav'n before mine eyes. And may at last my weary age Find out the peaceful hermitage, The hairy gown and mossy cell, Where I may sit and rightly spell Of every star that Heav'n doth shew, And every herb that sips the dew; Till old experience do attain To something like prophetic strain. These pleasures, Melancholy, give, And I with thee will choose to live.

    While like an angel I did see,
         Adorn’d the ground.
    Rich diamond and pearl and gold
         In ev’ry place was seen;Rare splendours, yellow, blue, red, white and green,
    Mine eyes did everywhere behold.Great wonders cloth’d with glory did appear,
         Amazement was my bliss,
    That and my wealth was ev’ry where:
         No joy to this!
    Curs’d and devis’d proprieties,
         With envy, avariceAnd fraud, those fiends that spoil even Paradise,
    Flew from the splendour of mine eyes,And so did hedges, ditches, limits, bounds,
         I dream’d not aught of those,
    But wander’d over all men’s grounds,
         And found repose.
    Proprieties themselves were mine,
         And hedges ornaments;Walls, boxes, coffers, and their rich contents
    Did not divide my joys, but all combine.Clothes, ribbons, jewels, laces, I esteem’d
         My joys by others worn:
    For me they all to wear them seem’d

                ","
The field is filled  with what we see without sleep. Never completely  closed, it quickly erodes  when tilled before rain.  If clogged with boulders it won’t be razed and once burdened cannot quicken under flocks. The field reveals glint and holds leaning, pulls twist from taut knots of buds. We watch the field  for stirring, wait  for stems to spring  back from sparrows. We hope for a swell  in its middle so  we can say we saw  the sway that comes from noticing.  Water meanders to prairie potholes,  throws cordgrass into switchbacks as we push past  bramble and scare  a whistling wheel of geese into air. The field draws hawks and sides of trains, cradles pools from storms where ducks plumb for water snails.  We trample light  between us, no way to lope in parting the swales. We must flatten  to fill the space with all the rolling wrapped up in us.  Before home,  the gabled barn  across the road throws the brightest rise we’ve ever seen the field try on.  The field is not in rows, is not  a faded saw-songed croon. It pushes green a mist above mud, shows how we make do. We wonder what we’re not  in the field. What scours, cuts, or knocks. If we could stay and still feel full the low line rounding  out a spread of subtle slope.

John-O was given a key to the apartment. The deal
was this: if Phil died suddenly, and John-O heard,
he would rush on over, enter the apartment, leave
unseen with Phil’s brown suitcase, and secretly pitch it
into the mounded deeps of the city dump.
Simply, there were things that Phil didn’t want
to hurt his family with. Do you have yours?
I have mine. The brown suitcase. Sasha’s sister,
on her deathbed—dinky, frail, just a mild
skim-milk trickle of a hospice patient—
tensed, sat up, and unloosed
such confessional invective that it seemed the walls
and the sheets would have to be splattered in shit,
her cancer having acted with the harsh, disbursing
force of a tornado on the brown and hard-shelled
suitcase in her electrochemical memory webs.
Is yours secure? from love? from sodium pentathol?
Last year, when a tornado hit our fringe
of downtown businesses, the air was alive for counties around
with the downward dance of naked canceled checks,
handwritten notes, hotel receipts, e-mail transcripts,
smeary Polaroids, a swirl of lacy underwisps
that jellyfished the skies, and from The G-Spot Shoppe
a rain of plastic pleasure aids, of which one prime example
pierced a cow between the eyes and struck her dead.
Maybe AIDS—I wasn’t sure. But he was dying,that was sure: as dry as a stick of human chalk,
and making the terrible scritch-sound of a stick of chalk,
in his throat, in the community air, in the room
across from Sasha’s sister. Something . . . hidden
in the trace of rundown aura still around him
as we chatted there one morning . . . a tv? a sissyboy tv?
I wasn’t sure, but it was obvious
his life-chalk held a story not yet written,
not confessed yet
for this storyniverous planet.
And when I remembered my mother’s own
last days . . . the way a person is a narrative,
the strength of which is either
revelation or withholding. It was summer, and the garden
at the nursing home was fat with summer’s pleasures:
flowered mounds like reefs of coral,
bees as globular as whole yolks.
In her room, my mother disappeared a breath
at a time, and everything else was only a kind of scenery for that.
The wink of pollen in the light. The birds. Their feather-lice.
The bursting spores. Those opened-up
cicada husks abandoned on the patio
—the small, brown, unlocked luggage
that’s completed its work in this world.

The woods of Arcady are dead, And over is their antique joy; Of old the world on dreaming fed; Grey Truth is now her painted toy; Yet still she turns her restless head: But O, sick children of the world, Of all the many changing things In dreary dancing past us whirled, To the cracked tune that Chronos sings, Words alone are certain good. Where are now the warring kings, Word be-mockers? — By the RoodWhere are now the warring kings? An idle word is now their glory, By the stammering schoolboy said, Reading some entangled story: The kings of the old time are dead; The wandering earth herself may be Only a sudden flaming word, In clanging space a moment heard, Troubling the endless reverie. Then nowise worship dusty deeds, Nor seek, for this is also sooth, To hunger fiercely after truth, Lest all thy toiling only breeds New dreams, new dreams; there is no truth Saving in thine own heart. Seek, then, No learning from the starry men, Who follow with the optic glass The whirling ways of stars that pass — Seek, then, for this is also sooth, No word of theirs — the cold star-bane Has cloven and rent their hearts in twain, And dead is all their human truth. Go gather by the humming sea Some twisted, echo-harbouring shell,And to its lips thy story tell, And they thy comforters will be, Rewarding in melodious guile Thy fretful words a little while, Till they shall singing fade in ruth And die a pearly brotherhood; For words alone are certain good: Sing, then, for this is also sooth. I must be gone: there is a grave Where daffodil and lily wave, And I would please the hapless faun, Buried under the sleepy ground, With mirthful songs before the dawn. His shouting days with mirth were crowned; And still I dream he treads the lawn, Walking ghostly in the dew, Pierced by my glad singing through, My songs of old earth's dreamy youth: But ah! she dreams not now; dream thou! For fair are poppies on the brow: Dream, dream, for this is also sooth.

The same with Chen. Whether last year or the one before.   
Soon after our arrival, Budberg, gently pensive,   
Said that in the beginning it is hard to get accustomed,   
For here there is no spring or summer, no winter or fall.   
“I kept dreaming of snow and birch forests.   
Where so little changes you hardly notice how time goes by.

They were prominent in our region,   
This Russian family, descendants of German Balts.   
I read none of his works, too specialized.   
And Chen, I have heard, was an exquisite poet,

Sultry Octobers, cool Julys, trees blossom in February.   
Here the nuptial flight of hummingbirds does not forecast spring.   
Only the faithful maple sheds its leaves every year.   
For no reason, its ancestors simply learned it that way.   
I sensed Budberg was right and I rebelled.   
So I won’t have power, won’t save the world?   
Fame will pass me by, no tiara, no crown?   
Did I then train myself, myself the Unique,   
To compose stanzas for gulls and sea haze,   
To listen to the foghorns blaring down below?
Until it passed. What passed? Life.   
Now I am not ashamed of my defeat.   
One murky island with its barking seals   
Or a parched desert is enough   
To make us say: yes, oui, si.
""Even asleep we partake in the becoming of the world.”

Through Alpine meadows soft-suffused With rain, where thick the crocus blows, Past the dark forges long disused, The mule-track from Saint Laurent goes. The bridge is cross'd, and slow we ride, Through forest, up the mountain-side. The autumnal evening darkens round, The wind is up, and drives the rain; While, hark! far down, with strangled sound Doth the Dead Guier's stream complain, Where that wet smoke, among the woods, Over his boiling cauldron broods. Swift rush the spectral vapours white Past limestone scars with ragged pines, Showing—then blotting from our sight!— Halt—through the cloud-drift something shines! High in the valley, wet and drear, The huts of Courrerie appear. Strike leftward! cries our guide; and higher Mounts up the stony forest-way. At last the encircling trees retire; Look! through the showery twilight grey What pointed roofs are these advance?— A palace of the Kings of France? Approach, for what we seek is here! Alight, and sparely sup, and wait For rest in this outbuilding near; Then cross the sward and reach that gate. Knock; pass the wicket! Thou art come To the Carthusians' world-famed home. The silent courts, where night and day Into their stone-carved basins cold The splashing icy fountains play— The humid corridors behold! Where, ghostlike in the deepening night, Cowl'd forms brush by in gleaming white. The chapel, where no organ's peal Invests the stern and naked prayer— With penitential cries they kneel And wrestle; rising then, with bare And white uplifted faces stand, Passing the Host from hand to hand; Each takes, and then his visage wan Is buried in his cowl once more. The cells!—the suffering Son of Man Upon the wall—the knee-worn floor— And where they sleep, that wooden bed, Which shall their coffin be, when dead! The library, where tract and tome Not to feed priestly pride are there, To hymn the conquering march of Rome, Nor yet to amuse, as ours are! They paint of souls the inner strife, Their drops of blood, their death in life. The garden, overgrown—yet mild, See, fragrant herbs are flowering there! Strong children of the Alpine wild Whose culture is the brethren's care; Of human tasks their only one, And cheerful works beneath the sun. Those halls, too, destined to contain Each its own pilgrim-host of old, From England, Germany, or Spain— All are before me! I behold The House, the Brotherhood austere! —And what am I, that I am here? For rigorous teachers seized my youth, And purged its faith, and trimm'd its fire, Show'd me the high, white star of Truth, There bade me gaze, and there aspire. Even now their whispers pierce the gloom: What dost thou in this living tomb? Forgive me, masters of the mind! At whose behest I long ago So much unlearnt, so much resign'd— I come not here to be your foe! I seek these anchorites, not in ruth, To curse and to deny your truth; Not as their friend, or child, I speak! But as, on some far northern strand, Thinking of his own Gods, a Greek In pity and mournful awe might stand Before some fallen Runic stone— For both were faiths, and both are gone. Wandering between two worlds, one dead, The other powerless to be born, With nowhere yet to rest my head, Like these, on earth I wait forlorn. Their faith, my tears, the world deride— I come to shed them at their side. Oh, hide me in your gloom profound, Ye solemn seats of holy pain! Take me, cowl'd forms, and fence me round, Till I possess my soul again; Till free my thoughts before me roll, Not chafed by hourly false control! For the world cries your faith is now But a dead time's exploded dream; My melancholy, sciolists say, Is a pass'd mode, an outworn theme— As if the world had ever had A faith, or sciolists been sad! Ah, if it be pass'd, take away, At least, the restlessness, the pain; Be man henceforth no more a prey To these out-dated stings again! The nobleness of grief is gone Ah, leave us not the fret alone! But—if you cannot give us ease— Last of the race of them who grieve Here leave us to die out with these Last of the people who believe! Silent, while years engrave the brow; Silent—the best are silent now. Achilles ponders in his tent, The kings of modern thought are dumb, Silent they are though not content, And wait to see the future come. They have the grief men had of yore, But they contend and cry no more. Our fathers water'd with their tears This sea of time whereon we sail, Their voices were in all men's ears We pass'd within their puissant hail. Still the same ocean round us raves, But we stand mute, and watch the waves. For what avail'd it, all the noise And outcry of the former men?— Say, have their sons achieved more joys, Say, is life lighter now than then? The sufferers died, they left their pain— The pangs which tortured them remain. What helps it now, that Byron bore, With haughty scorn which mock'd the smart, Through Europe to the Ætolian shore The pageant of his bleeding heart? That thousands counted every groan, And Europe made his woe her own? What boots it, Shelley! that the breeze Carried thy lovely wail away, Musical through Italian trees Which fringe thy soft blue Spezzian bay? Inheritors of thy distress Have restless hearts one throb the less? Or are we easier, to have read, O Obermann! the sad, stern page, Which tells us how thou hidd'st thy head From the fierce tempest of thine age In the lone brakes of Fontainebleau, Or chalets near the Alpine snow? Ye slumber in your silent grave!— The world, which for an idle day Grace to your mood of sadness gave, Long since hath flung her weeds away. The eternal trifler breaks your spell; But we—we learned your lore too well! Years hence, perhaps, may dawn an age, More fortunate, alas! than we, Which without hardness will be sage, And gay without frivolity. Sons of the world, oh, speed those years; But, while we wait, allow our tears! Allow them! We admire with awe The exulting thunder of your race; You give the universe your law, You triumph over time and space! Your pride of life, your tireless powers, We laud them, but they are not ours. We are like children rear'd in shade Beneath some old-world abbey wall, Forgotten in a forest-glade, And secret from the eyes of all. Deep, deep the greenwood round them waves, Their abbey, and its close of graves! But, where the road runs near the stream, Oft through the trees they catch a glance Of passing troops in the sun's beam— Pennon, and plume, and flashing lance! Forth to the world those soldiers fare, To life, to cities, and to war! And through the wood, another way, Faint bugle-notes from far are borne, Where hunters gather, staghounds bay, Round some fair forest-lodge at morn. Gay dames are there, in sylvan green; Laughter and cries—those notes between! The banners flashing through the trees Make their blood dance and chain their eyes; That bugle-music on the breeze Arrests them with a charm'd surprise. Banner by turns and bugle woo: Ye shy recluses, follow too! O children, what do ye reply?— ""Action and pleasure, will ye roam Through these secluded dells to cry And call us?—but too late ye come! Too late for us your call ye blow, Whose bent was taken long ago. ""Long since we pace this shadow'd nave; We watch those yellow tapers shine, Emblems of hope over the grave, In the high altar's depth divine; The organ carries to our ear Its accents of another sphere. ""Fenced early in this cloistral round Of reverie, of shade, of prayer, How should we grow in other ground? How can we flower in foreign air? —Pass, banners, pass, and bugles, cease; And leave our desert to its peace!""

From the forests and highlands          We come, we come; From the river-girt islands,          Where loud waves are dumb                 Listening to my sweet pipings. The wind in the reeds and the rushes,          The bees on the bells of thyme, The birds on the myrtle bushes,          The cicale above in the lime, And the lizards below in the grass, Were as silent as ever old Tmolus was,                 Listening to my sweet pipings. Liquid Peneus was flowing,          And all dark Tempe lay In Pelion's shadow, outgrowing          The light of the dying day,                 Speeded by my sweet pipings. The Sileni, and Sylvans, and Fauns,          And the Nymphs of the woods and the waves, To the edge of the moist river-lawns,          And the brink of the dewy caves, And all that did then attend and follow, Were silent with love, as you now, Apollo,                 With envy of my sweet pipings. I sang of the dancing stars,          I sang of the daedal Earth, And of Heaven, and the giant wars,          And Love, and Death, and Birth—                 And then I chang'd my pipings, Singing how down the vale of Maenalus          I pursu'd a maiden and clasp'd a reed. Gods and men, we are all deluded thus!          It breaks in our bosom and then we bleed. All wept, as I think both ye now would, If envy or age had not frozen your blood,                 At the sorrow of my sweet pipings.

Upon a bank, easeless with knobs of gold, 
 Beneath a canopy of noonday smoke,I saw a measureless Beast, morose and bold,
 With eyes like one from filthy dreams awoke, Who stares upon the daylight in despair For very terror of the nothing there.This beast in one flat hand clutched vulture-wise 
 A glittering image of itself in jet,And with the other groped about its eyes
 To drive away the dreams that pestered it; And never ceased its coils to toss and beat The mire encumbering its feeble feet.Sharp was its hunger, though continually
 It seemed a cud of stones to ruminate, And often like a dog let glittering lie
 This meatless fare, its foolish gaze to sate; Once more convulsively to stoop its jaw, Or seize the morsel with an envious paw.Indeed, it seemed a hidden enemy
 Must lurk within the clouds above that bank,It strained so wildly its pale, stubborn eye,
 To pierce its own foul vapours dim and dank; Till, wearied out, it raved in wrath and foam, Daring that Nought Invisible to come.Ay, and it seemed some strange delight to find 
 In this unmeaning din, till, suddenly, As if it heard a rumour on the wind,
 Or far away its freer children cry,Lifting its face made-quiet, there it stayed, Till died the echo its own rage had made.That place alone was barren where it lay;
 Flowers bloomed beyond, utterly sweet and fair; And even its own dull heart might think to stay 
 In livelong thirst of a clear river there,Flowing from unseen hills to unheard seas, Through a still vale of yew and almond trees.And then I spied in the lush green below
 Its tortured belly, One, like silver, pale, With fingers closed upon a rope of straw,
 That bound the Beast, squat neck to hoary tail; Lonely in all that verdure faint and deep, He watched the monster as a shepherd sheep.I marvelled at the power, strength, and rage
 Of this poor creature in such slavery bound; Fettered with worms of fear; forlorn with age;
 Its blue wing-stumps stretched helpless on the ground; While twilight faded into darkness deep, And he who watched it piped its pangs asleep.

Alone I list
   In the leafy tryst;
Silent the woodlands in their starry sleep—
Silent the phantom wood in waters deep:   
No footfall of a wind along the pass   
Startles a harebell—stirs a blade of grass.
   Yonder the wandering weeds,
   Enchanted in the light,
Stand in the gusty hollows, still and white;
   Yonder are plumy reeds,
Dusking the border of the clear lagoon;   
   Far off the silver clifts
Hang in ethereal light below the moon;   
   Far off the ocean lifts,
Tossing its billows in the misty beam,   
And shore-lines whiten, silent as a dream:
I hark for the bird, and all the hushed hills harken:
This is the valley: here the branches darken   
          The silver-lighted stream.
               
          Hark—
   That rapture in the leafy dark!
Who is it shouts upon the bough aswing,   
Waking the upland and the valley under?   
What carols, like the blazon of a king,
   Fill all the dawn with wonder?

When the first morning on the mountains sprang:
And now he shouts, and the world is young again!
          Carol, my king,
   On your bough aswing!
Thou art not of these evil days—
Thou art a voice of the world’s lost youth:   
Oh, tell me what is duty—what is truth—
How to find God upon these hungry ways;
   Tell of the golden prime,
When bird and beast could make a man their friend ;
When men beheld swift deities descend,   
Before the race was left alone with Time,   
Homesick on Earth, and homeless to the end;
   Before great Pan was dead,
   Before the naiads fled;
When maidens white with dark eyes shy and bold,
With peals of laughter on the peaks of gold,   
   Startled the still dawn—
Shone in upon the mountains and were gone,   
Their voices fading silverly in depths of forests old.
Sing of the wonders of their woodland ways,   
Before the weird earth-hunger of these days,
   When there was rippling mirth,   
   When justice was on Earth,
And light and grandeur of the Golden Age;   
   When never a heart was sad,
When all from king to herdsman had   
   A penny for a wage.
Ah, that old time has faded to a dream—
The moon’s fair face is broken in the stream;   
Yet shout and carol on, O bird, and let   
The exiled race not utterly forget;   
Publish thy revelation on the lawns—
Sing ever in the dark ethereal dawns;
   Sometime, in some sweet year,
These stormy souls, these men of Earth may hear.
          But hark again,
   From the secret glen,
That voice of rapture and ethereal youth   
   Now laden with despair.
   Forbear, O bird, forbear:
Is life not terrible enough forsooth?   
   Cease, cease the mystic song—
No more, no more, the passion and the pain:   
It wakes my life to fret against the chain;   
It makes me think of all the agéd wrong—
Of joy and the end of joy and the end of all—
Of souls on Earth, and souls beyond recall.   
   Ah, ah, that voice again!
It makes me think of all these restless men   
Called into time—their progress and their goal;
   And now, oh now, it sends into my soul   
Dreams of a love that might have been for me—
That might have been—and now can never be.

Show me the snowy summits dim in air;

   Wild odors of the pine,

Through the pale poplars by the pond:   
Hark! he is shouting in the field beyond.   
   Ho, there he goes
   Through the alder close!
He leaves me here behind him in his flight,   
And yet my heart goes with him out of sight!

Down leafy ways, dewy and cool and dim;

Down winding paths, across the flowery mead,   
Down silent hollows where the woodbine blows,

Canyons and cliffs by mortal feet untrod!

From vale to vale fleet-footed rumors run,   
With sudden apprehension of the sun;
   A light wind stirs
The filmy tops of delicate dim firs,
And on the river border blows,
Breaking the shy bud softly to a rose.   
   Sing out, O throstle, sing:
   I follow on, my king:
Lead me forever through the crimson dawn—
Till the world ends, lead me on!
Ho there! he shouts again—he sways—and now,
   Upspringing from the bough,
Flashing a glint of dew upon the ground,
   Without a sound
He drops into a valley and is gone!

In a drawer I found a map of the world,
folded into eighths and then once again
and each country bore the wrong name because
the map of the world is an orphanage.
The edges of the earth had a margin
as frayed as the hem of the falling night
and a crease moved down toward the center of
the earth, halving the identical stars.
Every river ran with its thin blue
brother out from the heart of a country:
there cedars twisted toward the southern sky
and reeds plumed eastward like an augur’s pens.
No dates on the wrinkles of that broad face,
no slow grinding of mountains and sand, for—
all at once, like a knife on a whetstone—
the map of the world spoke in snakes and tongues.
The hard-topped roads of the western suburbs
and the distant lights of the capitol
each pull away from the yellowed beaches
and step into the lost sea of daybreak.
The map of the world is a canvas turning
away from the painter’s ink-stained hands
while the pigments cake in their little glass
jars and the brushes grow stiff with forgetting.
There is no model, shy and half-undressed,
no open window and flickering lamp,
yet someone has left this sealed blue letter,
this gypsy’s bandana on the darkening
Table, each corner held down by a conch
shell. What does the body remember at
dusk? That the palms of the hands are a map
of the world, erased and drawn again and
Again, then covered with rivers and earth.

The light here leaves you
lonely, fading
as does the dusk
that takes too long
to arrive. By morning
the mountain moving
a bit closer to the sun.
This valley belongs
to no one—
except birds who name
themselves by their songs
in the dawn.
What good
are wishes, if they aren't
used up
The lamp of your arms.

to scale.

blurred world
where does it end—
The wind
kicks up the scent
from the stables
where horseshoes hold
not just luck, but
beyond. But
weight. But a body
that itself burns,
begs to run.
The gondola quits just
past the clouds.
The telephone poles
tall crosses in the road.
Let us go
each, into the valley—
turn ourselves
& our hairshirts
inside out, let the world
itch—for once—

Black like an eye
bruised night brightens
by morning, yellow
then grey—
a memory.
What the light was like.
All day the heat a heavy,
colored coat.
I want to lie
down like the lamb—
down & down
till gone—
shorn of its wool.
The cool
of setting & rising
in this valley,
the canyon between us
shoulders our echoes.
Moan, & make way.
*       *       *
The sun's small fury
feeds me.
Wind dying down.
We delay, & dither
then are lifted
into it, brightness
all about—
O setting.
O the music
as we soar
is small, yet sating.
What you want—
Nobody, or nothing
fills our short journeying.
Above even the birds,
winging heavenward,
the world is hard
to leave behind
or land against—
must end.
I mean to make it.
Turning slow beneath
our feet,
finding sun, seen
from above,
this world looks
like us—mostly
salt, dark water.

It's death there
is no cure for
life the long
disease.
If we're lucky.
Otherwise, short
trip beyond.
And below.
Noon,
growing shadow.
I chase the quiet
round the house.
Soon the sound—
wind wills
its way against
the panes. Welcome
the rain.

the moon's squinting
into space.

bow like priests.
The storm lifts
up the leaves.

                    Conversation 9: On Varieties of Oblivion
                ","
After bitter resistance the river unravels into the night, he says. Washes our daily fare of war out into a dark so deaf, so almost without dimension there is no word to dive from. Body weight displaced by dreams whose own lack promises lucidity so powerful it could shoot a long take to mindlessness. Fish smell travels the regions of sleep, westward like young men and the dawn. Then I return, too early to bring anything back, unsure of what I want, terrified I’ll fail, by a hair, to seize it.
We talk because we can forget, she says. Our bodies open to the dark, and sand runs out. Oblivion takes it all with equal tenderness. As the sea does. As the past. Already it suffuses the present with more inclusive tonalities. Not orchestrating a melodic sequence, but rounding the memory of a rooster on top a hanging silence. Or injured flesh. Impersonal. Only an animal could be so.
 
An avatar of the holy ghost, he chuckles. Or the angel of the annunciation beating his wings against a door slammed shut. Behind it, love already plays the organ. Without the angel. He is invisible because we have rejected his message.
On the old photos, she says, I see a stranger staking out my skin. As if an apple could fall too far from the tree. Yet I call her “me,” “my” years of furtively expanding flesh, with almost-certainty. It’s a belief that seems exempt from doubt, as if it were the hinge on which my doubts and questions turn. Still, I may seem the same “I” to you while I’ve already rolled it through the next door. From left to right.

Cupped in my hand, a snowflake quivers lightly.
Thick patches of fog draw back to reveal
A mountain range, rolling like a melody.
I have gathered the inheritance of the four seasons.
There is no sign of man in the valley.
Picked wild flowers continue to grow,
Their flowering is their time of death.
Along the path in the primordial wood
Green sunlight flows through the slits.
A russet hawk interprets into bird cries
The mountain's tale of terror.
Abruptly I cry out,
""Hello, Bai—hua—Mountain.""
""Hello, my—child,"" comes the echo
From a distant waterfall.

A restless response from the land,
I whispered, and the snowflake
Drifted from my hand down the abyss.

                ","
Across the road from where we nap
under a dead elm dazzles the meadow
where the partisans strung the traitors up,
the meadow which their dangling shadows stain.
Belly up in vines a blasted tank
rusts flake by flake to lichened scrap iron
while horseflies harangue
the rippling green, July
a limbo of quavering yellow...
We wake to cattle lowing at dawn,
grass overgrowing summer—so like us
in love each hour with the noonday sun
that neither toils nor spins, its brightness
hovering, blinding us...
What would the dead say if they could see us,
lounging, talking, peering through brambles
at cemetery photographs sunk beneath
the undertow of milkweed shadows,
death dates smoothing back into the stone?
I think of Goya’s demon, old man flesh
hanging from his bones, long teeth bared in
an ass’s grin as he scrawls on a schoolboy’s
slate, What more can be done? Nothing...
while behind him a noose etched clean as
the moon rises through the inkblot
spiraling back into the hanged man’s mouth
as if blackness poured from his throat:
“When will you tire of us bogeymen,
caricatures of your father’s war,
our crimes half-forgotten, unforgiven?
All future blotted out when they hauled us
from our beds, our minds went dead
to everything but fear: Nightshirts
soaked in snowlight’s pall, we hunched in mud, each step
loud, too loud beside the farmhouse wall,
the seconds teetering till we drop...
What our betrayals were we know
with a knowledge intimate beyond revenge,
history the needle’s eye you can’t squeeze through.
The partisans cut us down, heaped us
in a mass grave our relatives dug up: Yes,
there were tears—even for us...
Now, like aliens from space on your TV shows,
we ravel into mist, surrounding
you the moment your eyes close...
Our pupils search out yours from behind
the mirror with your father’s stares,
fathers and sons melding in one mind—
but who are you to call us traitors, an outsider
judging through the smoke-haze of home:
Each blow exact, our own neighbors
beat us till the blood ran, beat us black
and blue...Even now, would they dare take us back,
older, wiser, necks broken by the yoke?
Moving in time as to a dance we buzz
and swarm across the meadow, dissolving
and glinting like fireflies in the hedge,
blown like milkweed in the moon’s wall eye.
But under your lids, you see us locked in cold,
shattered wheatstraw flecked in ice:
Chill as the night air on your sunburned neck
our eyes like X rays pierce the frost,
stalking every step the living take.”

ever know them (my neighbors) well.

When you leave a Real City, as Gertrude Stein did, and go to Oakland, as she did, you can say, as she did, there is no there, there. When you are a Hartford insurance executive, as Wallace Stevens was, and you have never been to Oklahoma, as he had not, you can invent people to dance there, as he did, and you can name them Bonnie and Josie. But a THERE depends on how, in the beginning, the wind breathes upon its surface. Shh: amethyst, sapphire. Lead. Crystal mirror. See, a cow-pond in Oklahoma. Under willows now, so the Osage man fishing there is in the shade. A bobwhite whistles from his fencepost, a hundred yards south of the pond. A muskrat-head draws a nest of Vs up to the pond’s apex, loses them there in the reeds and sedges where a redwing blackbird, with gold and scarlet epaulets flashing, perches on the jiggly buttonwood branch. Purple martins skim the pond, dip and sip, veer and swoop, check, pounce, crisscross each other’s flashing paths. His wife in the Indian Hospital with cancer. Children in various unhappiness. White clouds sail slowly across the pure blue pond. Turtles poke their heads up, watch the Indian man casting, reeling, casting, reeling. A bass strikes, is hooked, fights, is reeled in, pulls away again, is drawn back, dragged ashore, put on the stringer. In Oklahoma, Wally, here is Josie’s father. Something that is going to be nothing, but isn’t. Watch: now he takes the bass home, cleans and fries it. Shall I tell you a secret, Gert? You have to be there before it’s there. Daddy, would you pass them a plate of fish? See friends, it’s not a flyover here. Come down from your planes and you’ll understand. Here.

You hear the roadhouse before you see it,   
Its four-beat country tunes
Amplified like surf through the woods,   
Silencing bullfrog and red-tailed hawk,   
Setting beards of moss dancing
On dim, indeterminate trees
That border two-lane blacktop.
Docked tonight, you reveal the badge
Of the farmer, that blanched expanse of skin   
Where cap shades face, babyhood
Pallor above the sun-blackened jaw   
Bulging uneasy with a concrete grin   
And some inevitable need to weep.   
Don’t you think we live and breathe   
In the meantime, in lockstep
With dawn, sunset, brawling dawn?   
Even now, you await secrets worse   
Than the few known ways a seized sky   
Will come to survive your pity.
But on another far field, celebrated   
For its arrivals and evictions, you learn   
To be beautiful, never leading
A sensible life, playing ball in the early dark,   
Fighting for a taste of the sweet spot,   
In this uncut land, this straight-edged air.   
Whadya want to know that isn’t yet a mystery   
Somewhere, a confidential stumble, heat   
Lightning, a first-rate backseat turndown?   
So it is that later you track high above   
Familiar tamarack and ash, beginning   
The next inaccuracy alone, and again,   
Remembering that everything east of you
Has already happened, on the same cold ground,
In a swarm of time, finally spiked home   
To your surprise, nails flung to the air.
And us all thumbs to the hot hammer-licks   
You hear from the roadhouse before you see it.

from The Lady of the Lake: The Western Waves of Ebbing Day
                ","
The western waves of ebbing day Rolled o’er the glen their level way; Each purple peak, each flinty spire, Was bathed in floods of living fire. But not a setting beam could glow Within the dark ravines below, Where twined the path in shadow hid, Round many a rocky pyramid, Shooting abruptly from the dell Its thunder-splintered pinnacle; Round many an insulated mass, The native bulwarks of the pass, Huge as the tower which builders vain Presumptuous piled on Shinar’s plain. The rocky summits, split and rent, Formed turret, dome, or battlement, Or seemed fantastically set With cupola or minaret, Wild crests as pagod ever decked, Or mosque of Eastern architect. Nor were these earth-born castles bare, Nor lacked they many a banner fair; For, from their shivered brows displayed, Far o’er the unfathomable glade, All twinkling with the dewdrop sheen, The brier-rose fell in streamers green, And creeping shrubs, of thousand dyes, Waved in the west-wind’s summer sighs. Boon nature scattered, free and wild, Each plant or flower, the mountain’s child. Here eglantine embalmed the air, Hawthorn and hazel mingled there; The primrose pale, and violet flower, Found in each cliff a narrow bower; Fox-glove and night-shade, side by side, Emblems of punishment and pride, Grouped their dark hues with every stain The weather-beaten crags retain. With boughs that quaked at every breath, Gray birch and aspen wept beneath; Aloft, the ash and warrior oak Cast anchor in the rifted rock; And, higher yet, the pine-tree hung His shattered trunk, and frequent flung, Where seemed the cliffs to meet on high, His boughs athwart the narrowed sky. Highest of all, where white peaks glanced, Where glist’ning streamers waved and danced, The wanderer’s eye could barely view The summer heaven’s delicious blue; So wondrous wild, the whole might seem The scenery of a fairy dream. Onward, amid the copse ’gan peep A narrow inlet, still and deep, Affording scarce such breadth of brim As served the wild duck’s brood to swim. Lost for a space, through thickets veering, But broader when again appearing, Tall rocks and tufted knolls their face Could on the dark-blue mirror trace; And farther as the hunter strayed, Still broader sweep its channels made. The shaggy mounds no longer stood, Emerging from entangled wood, But, wave-encircled, seemed to float, Like castle girdled with its moat; Yet broader floods extending still Divide them from their parent hill, Till each, retiring, claims to be An islet in an inland sea. And now, to issue from the glen, No pathway meets the wanderer’s ken, Unless he climb, with footing nice A far projecting precipice. The broom’s tough roots his ladder made, The hazel saplings lent their aid; And thus an airy point he won, Where, gleaming with the setting sun, One burnished sheet of living gold, Loch Katrine lay beneath him rolled, In all her length far winding lay, With promontory, creek, and bay, And islands that, empurpled bright, Floated amid the livelier light, And mountains, that like giants stand, To sentinel enchanted land. High on the south, huge Benvenue Down to the lake in masses threw Crags, knolls, and mountains, confusedly hurled, The fragments of an earlier world; A wildering forest feathered o’er His ruined sides and summit hoar, While on the north, through middle air, Ben-an heaved high his forehead bare.

O those years! The green light of morning
and the still unswept pavements of pleasure—
summer yelled from every surface of the city
and supped at a horn
refilled from above.
Silent hour. Watery colors
of a pale green eye’s diluted stream
pictures in that magic green, glass dances,
shepherds and streams, a dome, pigeons—
woven, dispatched, shining, faded—
mutable clouds of happiness!
So you faced the day: the font
without bubbles, dawdling
buildings and staircases; the houses
locked up, it was for you to create
the morning, early jasmine,
its yelps, its incipient aboriginal
stream—still without end—O those years!
Something unquenchable in the heart,
complement to heaven and earth;
playing to you from reeds and gardens,
evening storms
drenched the brassy umbels,
darkly they burst, taut with seeds,
and sea and strands,
wimpled with tents,
full of burning sand,
weeks bronzing, tanning everything
to pelts for kisses landing
indiscriminately like cloudbursts
and soon over!
Even then
a weight overhead
grapes bunching
you pulled down the boughs and let them bounce up,
only a few berries
if you wanted
first—
not yet so bulging and overhung with
plate-sized fruit,
old heavy grape flesh—
O those years!                                ii
Dark days of spring,
unyielding murk in the leaves;
drooping lilacs, barely looking up
narcissus color, and smelling strongly of death,
loss of content,
untriumphant sadness of the unfulfilled.
And in the rain
falling on the leaves,
I hear an old forest song,
from forests I crossed
and saw again, but I didn’t return
to the hall where they were singing,
the keys were silent,
the hands were resting somewhere
apart from the arms that held me,
moved me to tears,
hands from the eastern steppes,
long since trampled and bloody—
only the forest song
in the rain
dark days of spring
the everlasting steppes.

For those of us who live at the shoreline
standing upon the constant edges of decision
crucial and alone
for those of us who cannot indulge
the passing dreams of choice
who love in doorways coming and going
in the hours between dawns
looking inward and outward
at once before and after
seeking a now that can breed
futures
like bread in our children’s mouths
so their dreams will not reflect
the death of ours;
 
For those of us
who were imprinted with fear
like a faint line in the center of our foreheads
learning to be afraid with our mother’s milk
for by this weapon
this illusion of some safety to be found
the heavy-footed hoped to silence us
For all of us
this instant and this triumph
We were never meant to survive.
 
And when the sun rises we are afraid
it might not remain
when the sun sets we are afraid
it might not rise in the morning
when our stomachs are full we are afraid
of indigestion
when our stomachs are empty we are afraid
we may never eat again
when we are loved we are afraid
love will vanish
when we are alone we are afraid
love will never return
and when we speak we are afraid
our words will not be heard
nor welcomed
but when we are silent
we are still afraid
 
So it is better to speak
remembering
we were never meant to survive.

Must be a stumbler, bleeder,
as some floccus remains here, carded
into ragged sleeves by barbed wire.
I’d believe in a God who can learn
to work new spindles, new pupils
uncomprehending the reasons
light rosins in winter, and still
spill clumsily, bleeding.
Now drizzle caught
in oily pockets loads the fleece
with wealth. I’ve often wondered
what the fence keeps out
in a country bereft of predators.
I long ago reconciled
instinctive sympathy
for the perfect innocence of animals
with an equally ardent carnivory.
Arms retreat guilt-free
through the widest breach
in the garment, having chosen a meal
the stauncher faiths call impassible,
withdrawing to empty folds.
I hope you feel safe when you die.

I got a letter through the post decreeing my sainthood.
Beatified, I sat down, because this was big news for me.

its butter of beginnings and endings in front of the sun.
What good, I wondered laterally, might befall an ancient

unseen in the earth, deep beneath a human tragedy?

                                              the man throwing red hot rivets
Coals in a bucket of change
How can you love a city that will not stay?
I love you
                       like a man of life in change.
 
Leaves like yesterday shed, the yellow of green spring
Like today accepted and become one’s self
I go, I am a city with bridges and tunnels,
Rock, cloud, ships, voices.     To the man where the river met
The tracks, now buried deep along the Drive
Where blossoms like sex pink, dense pink, rose, pink, red.
 
Towers falling.     A dream of towers.
Necessity of fountains.     And my poor,
Stirring among our dreams,
Poor of my own spirit, and tribes, hope of towers
And lives, looking out through my eyes.
The city the growing body of our hate and love.
The root of the soul, and war in its black doorways.
A male sustained cry interrupting nightmare.
Male flower heading upstream.
 
Among a city of light, the stone that grows.
Stigma of dead stone, inert water, the tattered
Monuments rivetted against flesh.
Blue noon where the wall made big agonized men
Stand like sailors pinned howling on their lines, and I
See stopped in time a crime behind green glass,
Lilies of all my life on fire.
Flash faith in a city building its fantasies.
 
I walk past the guards into my city of change.
 
 
3  JOURNEY CHANGES
 
Many of us     Each in his own life waiting
Waiting to move     Beginning to move     Walking
And early on the road of the hill of the world
Come to my landscapes emerging on the grass
 
The stages of the theatre of the journey
 
I see the time of willingness between plays
Waiting and walking and the play of the body
Silver body with its bosses and places
One by one touched awakened into into
 
Touched and turned one by one into     flame
 
The theatre of the advancing goddess     Blossoming
Smiles as she stands intensely being in stillness
Slowness in her blue dress advancing standing I go
And far across a field over the jewel grass
 
The play of the family stroke by stroke acted out
 
Gestures of deep acknowledging on the journey stages
Of the playings the play of the goddess and the god
A supple god of searching and reaching
Who weaves his strength     Who dances her more alive
 
The theatre of all animals, my snakes, my great horses
 
Always the journey     long     patient     many haltings
Many waitings for choice and again easy breathing
When the decision to go on is made
Along the long slopes of choice and again the world
 
The play of poetry approaching in its solving
 
Solvings of relations in poems and silences
For we were born to express     born for a journey
Caves, theatres, the companioned solitary way
And then I came to the place of mournful labor
 
A turn in the road and the long sight from the cliff
 
Over the scene of the land dug away to nothing and many
Seen to a stripped horizon carrying barrows of earth
A hod of earth taken and emptied and thrown away
Repeated farther than sight.     The voice saying slowly
 
But it is hell.     I heard my own voice in the words
Or it could be a foundation     And after the words
My chance came.     To enter.     The theatres of the world.
 
 
4  FRAGILE
 
I think of the image brought into my room
Of the sage and the thin young man who flickers and asks.
He is asking about the moment when the Buddha
Offers the lotus, a flower held out as declaration.
“Isn’t that fragile?” he asks.     The sage answers:
“I speak to you.     You speak to me.     Is that fragile?”
 
 
5  THE LONG BODY
 
This journey is exploring us. Where the child stood
An island in a river of crisis, now
The bridges bind us in symbol, the sea
Is a bond, the sky reaches into our bodies.
We pray : we dive into each other’s eyes.
 
Whatever can come to a woman can come to me.
 
This is the long body : into life from the beginning,
Big-headed infant unfolding into child, who stretches and finds
And then flowing the young one going tall, sunward,
And now full-grown, held, tense, setting feet to the ground,
Going as we go in the changes of the body,
As it is changes, in the long strip of our many
Shapes, as we range shifting through time.
The long body : a procession of images.
 
This moment in a city, in its dream of war.
                                              We chose to be,
Becoming the only ones under the trees
                                                                            when the harsh sound
Of the machine sirens spoke. There were these two men,
And the bearded one, the boys, the Negro mother feeding
Her baby. And threats, the ambulance with open doors.
Now silence. Everyone else within the walls. We sang.
                               We are the living island,
We the flesh of this island, being lived,
Whoever knows us is part of us today.
 
Whatever can happen to anyone can happen to me.
 
Fire striking its word among us, waterlilies
Reaching from darkness upward to a sun
Of rebirth, the implacable.     And in our myth
The Changing Woman who is still and who offers.
 
Eyes drinking light, transforming light, this day
That struggles with itself, brings itself to birth.
In ways of being, through silence, sources of light
Arriving behind my eye, a dialogue of light.
 
And everything a witness of the buried life.
This moment flowing across the sun, this force
Of flowers and voices body in body through space.
The city of endless cycles of the sun.

I was listening to a book on tape while driving
and when the author said, “Those days I delighted in everything,”
I pulled over and found a pencil and a parking ticket stub
because surely there was a passage of life where I thought
“These days I delight in everything,” right there in the
present, because they almost all feel like that now,
memory having markered only the outline while evaporating
the inner anxieties of earlier times. Did I not disparage
my body for years on end, for instance, although, in contrast
that younger one now strikes me as near-Olympian?
And the crushing preoccupations of that same younger self
might seem magically diluted, as though a dictator
in hindsight, had only been an overboard character — 
but not so. Where went the fear, dense as the sudden
dark in the woods, of being alone, or the bruise of 3:30 pm
in a silent apartment, when the disenfranchised live
only with the sunlight through the blinds, just prey
caught betwixt and between, and also heartbreak, and
again, heartbreak. I didn’t have whatever that time of life
then demanded — a book, a wedding band, a baby — 
but the present, like the lie of “fair and balanced” news reporting
where creationists are granted air time with the scientists,
the present might have me believe that “in those days
I delighted in everything.” But to be ... fair and balanced ...
I do trust the strict part of memory, the only archivist
to have savored a passage of time and have preserved it
with the translucent green hinges licked by stamp collectors,
attaching it without hurting it, so I wanted the quote
exactly, and go back to hunt and tag those months where I
delighted in everything — then I couldn’t find the ticket stub.
I rummaged through the recycling but no luck, and I
couldn’t go back to find the passage on tape, and then I realized
I had bought the book for my husband, so I started leafing through it,
not wanting to start too far back, and not wanting
my eyes to fall on a passage in the future, the one where
she realizes that “Those days I delighted in everything,”
but it was never to happen again, just the present, from here on in.

We were up late and everyone had been drinking, and someone said, Hey, is that God’s
head on the boil?
We didn’t know where to look or what to think, it was obviously some sort of perverse
joke, or not, right?
And the conversation went on for days, sober, drunk, asleep, awake, what did it matter?
Some of us felt the real time was for something, but what?
And the questions kept coming, once they started, my favorite one being two strung
together, What makes art “modern” and what does “urgent” mean now?
Where was the greater good? That was another one bandied about,
followed by Where was the common tent? which gave a feeling of empathy for a minute
and then grief because, well, where was it?
Will you arm, hoard seeds, go hungry? Those terrified me because, after all, who will
repair things when the end is pale or dark?
Where will you hide out
when capital runs out, when water? Which will be greater, the heat or the cold?
Wait, did God’s boiling head just say something? Cry out Go to hell from a giant lobster
pot? Tantalizing us with where to go next?
Are phosphorescent lamps to mark escape paths?
Not that it’s not a great party, but whose place is this? Igniting
quail in banana leaves, sons bandaged, who invited us?

It seems so different   art that moves me now
From the sort of art I longed for long ago
Soaring   Vatic   Agon
I waited yesterday on the unsure shoulder
Of a drenched back road    From my car I could behold
Our highway agent Gordon
Fill a rut with a spade  climb up on his grader
And smooth things smooth as the top of a kitchen table
There were frost heaves by the score
And culverts clotted shut by April floods
So it was brilliant    what Gordon did with mud
On Wallace Hill      Pure mire
Out there   The road goes narrow as a needle
On which   you might wonder   could dance how many angels
I don't care   I didn't
No earthly need to summon spirits   daemons
No sign of them at all    Nor would I dream one
I might have once but wouldn't
Nor gyre nor golem    Nor great Leviathan
Nor djinn     Nor fiend    Nor signifying wind
Nor Elementargeist
That lingering in that lane might make me conjure
I had to get somewhere and fetch my daughter
To bring her home     Sweet Christ
She might be standing in that mix of sleet
And ugly rain    which called for Gordon's art
I'm trying to be a grownup
Better late than never    I suppose
Or am I only jaded      I don't know
It was as though I'd shown up
Just to see him wield his spade and blade out there
It kept me from surmising some furordivinis    Why should I bother
Now that I moved on    thanks be to Gordon
Who signaled with his thumb for me to pass him
He pulled the grader overYes give me something useful here    I said
Impromptu        In my car it sounded odd
To say it now sounds different
I hope that Gordon watched me yesterday
As I signaled back    I'd never have made my way
Without a skillful agent
I hope he saw me wave

Such dancers, we have played the pipes of Pan:
The world was ours, each one of us a queen.
First, scarcely draped in tatters, and disheveled,
Then plaited with a starry diadem;
We’ve been in jails, at banquets we have reveled:
But the rewards of heaven, we’re lost to them,
Lost in nights of starlight, in the garden
Where apple trees from paradise are found.

In a hotel, even prayer feels adulterous,the skyline smudged in light, a distraction just before dusk. In the lobbya woman tells a stranger what she will dofor three hundred dollars, whatshe will do for four. Some have the custom of opening a book randomly with a question in mind. Some have the custom of  forgetting. At six my friend beat his father at chess, beat his father’s friends so easily he wondered if  they tried.At seven he shook the governor’s hand.Don’t call it a failure; call it knowledge:the peculiar taste that filled his mouth as if   he had bitten his cheek.Whatever he risked did not matter, whatever he could imagine was already lost.

He forgets that he used to call me mariconcito- that I harbored years of hatred toward him while hoping to find my real father. My childhood memories of him reminding me I was my mother's son, not his. I tried to poison him once and scattered sharp nails inside the shoes in his closet. By the time one of his sons died of AIDS I was already lost in contempt for the man I blamed for everything. There was the time I was in love and he met my boyfriend. Now he forgets to go to the bathroom   or where he is but he still remembers Michael and asks about him. I help him walk slowly outdoors to step outside the prison cell that is the tiny apartment with no windows in which I grew up abused by both of them. He barely understands. His fate has been torture. I know that I cannot be his savior. I used to pray for him to die but here he is slowly fading. In his eyes I see that he learned to love me and wishes he could take it all back. He is unable to recall those drunken nights and hateful words. I should   do the same. I left a long time ago but he still remains haunted by the little boy who wanted to belong. Like him, I want to forget that we made mistakes and caused so much pain. I need for both of us to remember how he taught me how to ride a bike and how to swim and told me, better late than never, that he loved me and was proud of all I had done. I have to help him settle into his favorite chair and let him know that I forgive him. There is a place somewhere where he will call me hijo and I will know him as my dad.

Was it Pascal who said “Almost all our misery has come from not being able to remain alone in our rooms”? Baudelaire thought it might have been, but was not sure. And let’s take a look at that “almost” which I’m very glad is there. I can think of lots of misery that had nothing to do with my not having been alone in my room. When I get a rejection email on a train for a piece of work I had high hopes for is one example. Or to go way back, when I returned home to find my white mouse dead when I was eleven or twelve. Or to take a mundane example, when a plane I’m booked on is twelve hours delayed, while I hang about the airport.
I have never had a huge problem with solitude, it is true. As a child I read voraciously, and would find some hidden corner to lurk with my book. The game of golf is one where one can enjoy being alone, especially very early on a beautiful morning. The time when I most felt alone was when the missionaries came to my school and we all had to endure a silent retreat for three days. At the end of that time  I felt like one of those astronauts in films who have to stay on the moon for months.
Baudelaire claimed his friend the Devil loved bleak, solitary places where the spirit of murder and lust was more likely to ignite. He decided that this was not really a danger for most of us, though, only for those idle, fanciful folk prone to enigmas and dreaming. The type of person who should most avoid being alone is a chatterbox or maybe a television pundit. But what’s to stop these people being verbose in their own company? Did Crusoe, for example, stay quiet on his island before Friday came? According to Elizabeth Bishop in her great poem, “Crusoe in England,” he did not.
And in order to write that poem, Ms. Bishop needed to be alone. This did not stop her from cooking meals and inviting friends to help her eat the food and drink wine with her. After this, probably the next morning, she went back to the poem and her solitude.
I feel the French maybe exaggerate the benefits of  being alone. That philosopher and writer Jean-Paul Sartre for example, his play Huis-clos with its famous line “L’enfer, c’est les autres.” Yes, we all know how annoying other people often are, and how strong the urge to escape from them can be. But the two characters Vladimir and Estragon in Beckett’s Waiting for Godot show that even in an absurdist setting companionship has its importance. It’s said Beckett got his inspiration for this play from one or other of two versions of Caspar David Friedrich’s painting Two Men Contemplating the Moon which he saw on a trip to Germany in 1936 or ’37. In both versions of the painting one of the men has his hand on the other man’s shoulder, a sign of companionship if ever there was one.
Baudelaire quotes the French philosopher and moralist Jean de la Bruyère (or Delabruyère, as the man signed himself), “What a great misfortune we cannot be alone,” as if to chastise anyone who wants to plunge into a crowd or go into a busy bar. What about the great French word fraternité, the third of the three words that were the rallying cry of the Revolution? I want to close this by giving another quote from de la Bruyère: “Out of difficulties grow miracles.” I prefer this one. Anyone in an awkward social situation should dwell on that.

No one hangs who had not already planned to hang.
At some point I’ve thrown almost everything,

Unenunciated stair-structures are closing off

poverty,
obscurity,
that you will leave me,

It was the dead center of summer,
& anyone but us would’ve been
outside hours ago, flailing
like a system of larks against
the hydrant’s icy spray. But a girl
had her orders, & to disobey
our mother was, in a sense, to invite
one’s own destruction, cause to pray
that a god of mercy might strike first.
So we lay, still as stars on the living
room floor, poring over algorithms:
divisors & dividends, quotient
the first synonym for resolution
I ever learned, & would later
come to love for its sound alone,
how it reminded me, even then,
of words like quantum & quotationmark, both ways of saying nothing
means what you think it means
all the time. The observable
universe hides behind its smooth
obsidian dress, & all we can
do is grasp at it in myths
& figures, see what sticks,
give all our best language
to the void. What dark irony,
these coy, child philosophers,
theorizing how things break
from the floor of a house
where everything is more
or less in flux, indeterminate
as the color of the blood
in a body. Or the speed
at which I learned
to obliterate the distance
between myself
& any given boy
on the block, the optimal
angle of the swing
most likely to drop
another kid cold
in front of his crew,
to square up, square
off, & this too was a kind
of education, the way
my sister held both fists
semi-adjacent, each an inch
or so from her switchblade
eyes, showed me
the stance you take
when the math doesn’t
quite shake out, so it’s just
you & the unknowns
& the unknowns
never win.

You’ll feel warm

A vision will come to me
of your exotic land: the sun

A drift of white blossoms
from the orange tree
will settle in my hair
and I’ll know.
This is how I will choose
you: by feeling you
smelling you, by slipping
you into my coat.
Maybe then I’ll climb
the hill, look down
on the town we live in
with sunlight on my face
and a miniature sun
burning a hole in my pocket.

shout, dragging your fear-ettes by their pinked ears.

                ","
By night we linger'd on the lawn,          For underfoot the herb was dry;          And genial warmth; and o'er the sky The silvery haze of summer drawn; And calm that let the tapers burn          Unwavering: not a cricket chirr'd:          The brook alone far-off was heard, And on the board the fluttering urn: And bats went round in fragrant skies,          And wheel'd or lit the filmy shapes          That haunt the dusk, with ermine capes And woolly breasts and beaded eyes; While now we sang old songs that peal'd          From knoll to knoll, where, couch'd at ease,          The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees Laid their dark arms about the field. But when those others, one by one,          Withdrew themselves from me and night,          And in the house light after light Went out, and I was all alone, A hunger seized my heart; I read          Of that glad year which once had been,          In those fall'n leaves which kept their green, The noble letters of the dead: And strangely on the silence broke          The silent-speaking words, and strange          Was love's dumb cry defying change To test his worth; and strangely spoke The faith, the vigour, bold to dwell          On doubts that drive the coward back,          And keen thro' wordy snares to track Suggestion to her inmost cell. So word by word, and line by line,          The dead man touch'd me from the past,          And all at once it seem'd at last The living soul was flash'd on mine, And mine in this was wound, and whirl'd          About empyreal heights of thought,          And came on that which is, and caught The deep pulsations of the world, Æonian music measuring out          The steps of Time—the shocks of Chance—          The blows of Death. At length my trance Was cancell'd, stricken thro' with doubt. Vague words! but ah, how hard to frame          In matter-moulded forms of speech,          Or ev'n for intellect to reach Thro' memory that which I became: Till now the doubtful dusk reveal'd          The knolls once more where, couch'd at ease,          The white kine glimmer'd, and the trees Laid their dark arms about the field: And suck'd from out the distant gloom          A breeze began to tremble o'er          The large leaves of the sycamore, And fluctuate all the still perfume, And gathering freshlier overhead,          Rock'd the full-foliaged elms, and swung          The heavy-folded rose, and flung The lilies to and fro, and said ""The dawn, the dawn,"" and died away;          And East and West, without a breath,          Mixt their dim lights, like life and death, To broaden into boundless day.

As we drove back, crossing the hill,
The house still
Hidden in the trees, I always thought—

Fire, someone could have broken in.   
As if things must have been
Too good here. Still, we always found   
It locked tight, safe and sound.
I mentioned that, once, as a joke;   
No doubt we spoke
Of the absurdity
To fear some dour god’s jealousy   
Of our good fortune. From the farm   
Next door, our neighbors saw no harm   
Came to the things we cared for here.   
What did we have to fear?
Maybe I should have thought: all
Such things rot, fall—
Barns, houses, furniture.
We two are stronger than we were
Apart; we’ve grown
Together. Everything we own
Can burn; we know what counts—some such   
Idea. We said as much.
We’d watched friends driven to betray;   
Felt that love drained away
Some self they need.
We’d said love, like a growth, can feed   
On hate we turn in and disguise;
We warned ourselves. That you might despise   
Me—hate all we both loved best—
None of us ever guessed.
The house still stands, locked, as it stood   
Untouched a good
Two years after you went.
Some things passed in the settlement;   
Some things slipped away. Enough’s left   
That I come back sometimes. The theft   
And vandalism were our own.
Maybe we should have known.

At least that’s what they say,
His Mum and Pop
Trying to be proud
As all the nurses gather round
To squint into the cloud

The head nurse finally thunders
Into the awe and argument
Swirling through the crowd
Where someone mutters half-aloudIn all my years…
 
Serious never hears.
Serious spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
In the best bed there is,
Where there’s no guilt and no sin,
No child more inner than this;
Nothing to will
And nothing to want,
No body you both are and haunt;
No drug of disappointment
Or feeling that there’s never now
(Or do these seep in somehow?);
No suffering the world’s idiocy
 
Like a saint its pains;
No traffic and no planes;
No debts, no taxes,
No phones and no faxes;
No rockslide of information
Called the Internet.
 
Serious isn’t. Yet.
 
 
2.
Serious hears a sound.
Not unusual, in itself, nothing to be concerned about.
Here and there there’s been a shout,
A song he seemed to be inside,
The weird whale-calls of her gas.
This, too, shall pass.
 
Then it comes again,
And with a far-off force
Which a shrink less serious than he
Will have him dream is a drain
That all his impurity
Is slowly drifting toward(Down, Serious says, down!) 
Beyond which he’ll be clean,
Feel no pain…
 
Then the dark erupts in a rain
Of blood and muck
He seems to mostly be,
Holding on for all he’s worth,
Which isn’t much, finally,
Little wizened thing
Plopping out to an earth
Where cries of agony
Dwindle to equivocal joy(It’s, it’s…is it a boy?) 
And some clear world lies
Just beyond the eyes
You can’t quite open;
 
And everything is wet,
And loud, and broken;
And all of life is one huge tit
You’re meant to somehow suck.
 
Serious staggers to his feet,
Slaps himself harder than the doctor did
And says, I’m fucked.

Serious is learning silence
In the way most children learn to speak.Poshlust!
He gasps after his first feeding,Götterdämmerung in his first dusk,
His whole body writhing with a kind of violence
As if the world had wounded him,
Words his bleeding.
 Anomie, Deus absconditus
Drift into the air above his crib;Accursed progenitor, quintessence of dust
Dribble with the pap onto his bib;
As day by day, and week by week,
Serious wrestles with this difficult gift,
Forgetting, which, it seems, he is on this earth to do.
 Boob, ass, oaf,
Riving out of him like greatness going off;Ninny, crackpate, clunkhead, gorm,
Leaving him gasping and bent;fragments, sheep, rabble,
All falling, falling from him
Backwards into babble...
 
Finally Serious lies there, spent,
Language like some immense ghostly mobile
Bobbing just above his bed,
All power of movement gone as well:
 
Useless little buglike arms, buglike little fingers,
This heavy, heavy head.
 
And now if there’s something Serious can’t quite taste,
Or if he feels too acutely his own waste,
Or knows too acutely what he can’t tell,
He screams and screams
Until the world knows what Serious means.

Serious goes to school.Just try it, his Mum says
As she lets go his hand
And wipes a last glaze
Of doughnut from his nose,
And Serious, insofar as Serious can,
Does give it a good try,
Though it’s hard to understand
Why they keep taking a break
From taking breaks, or why
They can’t simply walk
In line down the hall,
Or what, finally, is at stake
In a game of kickball.
 
It’s time to draw a tree.
What a relief to work alone,
Serious thinks, as he picks a scab
For just the right tinge of sky,
Breaks his sugar cookie
To make a place of stone,
And fashions out of bread
A man with a huge head
And huge, ruined wings,
Gasping at all the ruined things
To which he’s tumbled.
And calls it: Cookie, Crumbled.
 Oh my, the teacher says
When she walks by,Those are interesting trees. 
Serious closes his eyes and sees
As in a vision of doom
Himself drowning in schools,
A whole ocean of fools
Nipping, nipping at him
With their tiny, tiny teeth.
And Serious sighs
With a prophet’s wisdom
As he climbs up into his seat,
Stares out across the room
And like a prophet cries:You’re all going to die!
 
The class is a tomb.
Serious, rigid, waits.
A girl in pigtails giggles,
Then another near the back.
And as if along a fuse
The giggling goes
Up and down the rows
Till someone makes a crack
About his coat and tie
And the laughter detonates.
 
Serious climbs slowly down
Into that inferno of sound
Which the teacher’s shouts
Are only driving higher,
Packs up his lunchbox, his dignity,
And his copy of Sartre,
 
And strides with a prophet’s gaze
Through all that derisive fire.
Only once does he turn,
Briefly, to look back through the blaze
At the iron fact of his art,
Smaller from here, but unburned.
 
 
5.
Serious loves his Mum.
And then he doesn’t, quite.
It’s that way with everything—
Baths and plums,
The blessèd silence of night.
 Would you like to help with this?
His mother asks
As she rolls out biscuit dough
And cuts it with a glass
Or folds the clothes
Still warm from the sun.
But Serious knows
He was born with a task,
And though he touches the clothes
And tastes the dough,
Serious says, No.
 
Serious stays in the bath
Until his skin is shriveled and cold,
Eats himself sick on plums,
Feels in the dark
The dark he becomes,
And cries out in the night for his Mum.
 
 
6.
Serious is older now.
He just is.Thank God, Serious says,
For whom childhood, that stupid carousel that never stops,
Always had an element of disingenuousness:
The tristesse of lollipops,
The sham of naps;
Fools dandling you on their laps
So you can play horsey, which damn sure isn’t serious;
And all that endless business
Of pretending to be curious
About the most obvious things:
What’s night? Where’s Mama-Cat?
What’s wrong with Pop? Can God die?
Why, why, why?
 
To hell with that,
Serious thinks, as he sits incinerating memories
One by one,
Saying their names as he feeds them
Like photographs to a fire:
Here he is in a baseball uniform
Squinting back the sun;
Here in a blue tuxedo with a ruffled front;
And here, Lord, with pimples.
He pauses a moment.
Do memories have names?
And what, exactly, are these flames?
To hell with that!
Done.
 
Serious owns a car, pays taxes,
Contemplates a pension,
Has a crease of gray along his temples,
But he is young, young.
He develops headaches, begins sleeping badly, and relaxes,
You might say, into the constant tension
That he really always was,
With far, far too much to do
To look anywhere but onward,
Or to answer the questions of a child
With anything true.
 
 
7.
Serious isn’t Stupid,
Though they go to the same gym.
Serious sees him dropping weights
Or picking his butt and thinks,
At least I’m not him.
Nor is he Mean or Vain,
Those chiseled twins
With matching boots and belts,
Nor Smug who notes their sins,
Nor Shallow noting something else;
He isn’t useless Timid
Who no matter what won’t complain,
Nor fat-assed Nice sweating honey
On all the machines,
Nor Self-Loathing who smudges mirrors,
Nor Whacked who licks them clean.
Serious isn’t Funny.
 
Serious spreads his towel on the bench,
Sits down in front of his own image,
And Serious strains at a serious weight.
And never, not once, when he’s seen
In myriad mirrors around the room
That everyone else is straining too,
Has he caught himself too late
And finished with a roar
And more strength
Than he’s ever had before:I AM NOT YOU!
 
 
8.
Serious has a date with Doom.
It’s not the first, and seems unlikely to be the last,
For they get on quite well, Doom and he,
Share similar pasts
And similar ideas about what life should be.
It seems, in fact, that this might just bloom.
 
And what a relief.
After Morose and Mad and Neurotic;
After almost falling for Grief,
Who was so exotic
She made all the others seem tame.
Then to discover she even lied about her name.
And to sleep with another Serious! That was odd,
Like wrestling with an angel,
Though it was hard to tell from that rough unsated tangle
Which one was Serious, and which one God.
 
But how easy it is to be himself with Doom,
Serious thinks, as he puts the wine in to chill
And sets two glasses on a tray,
Who always wants whatever Serious wants
And always agrees with what he has to say;
Who doesn’t need to hear that whole spiel
About “going too fast” or “needing more room”;
And who doesn’t probe and pry that long needle into his brain
—What do you feel? What do you feel?—
Until it’s all Serious can do not to stand up and scream: Pain!
 
Lucky to be alive.
And if he still has no clear idea where she lives,
And never knows quite when she’ll arrive,
Still, something about Doom feels right
To Serious, and he looks forward to their dates.
He checks himself in the mirror, dims the light,
And waits.
 
 
9.
Serious is a traveler.
“Traveling broadens the mind,”
The man beside him says,
His tray table down and seat reclined
Even as they're taking off,
And Serious, who has his eyes closed
So he can do what Serious does,
Begins to cough.
 
               What do they say, what do they fear, 
               Is this song joy or grief? 
               This is a man, this is a god. 
               Who are you and why are you here? 
               To leave, to leave.
 
The meal is over,
Which Serious declined.
In the shell-roar of the cabin
He eases somewhat, is surprised to find
He could almost drift away.
“What line of work are you in?”
He hears the man beside him say,
And Serious begins coughing wildly again.
 
               What is that smell, what was that sound, 
               Isn’t that ice on the wings? 
               This is the air, there is the water, 
               But what do you do on the way down? 
               You scream, you scream.
 
How far they must have gone by now,
That old familiar world miles behind,
The man eats an orange,
And now he eats the rind.
He eats his plate, his plastic fork, chews
With animal relish his Styrofoam cup,
Leans over to eat bittersweet Serious too,
Who startles and wakes up.
 
               Look at the desert, look at the green, 
               Is there an end to that ice? 
               Here is a place, and here is a place, 
               But what is the space between? 
               It’s life, it’s life.
 
 
10.
Serious is married.
What a weird wind this is,
He thinks, so still at times,
Then stinging the eyes to tears.
And how he seems both more and less
Himself, and how it seems at once all of loneliness
And something he can hold.
Or is it he who's being carried?
He shivers, and reaches out for her again.
Or is it she who reaches, she who's cold?
What is this wind?
Where are these years?
 
 
11.
Serious experiences loss.
Just like that.
Flat.
Serious experiences loss,
 
As if he’d come to some sheer cliff
There was no way around,
No way to cross,
And found,
On the other side
Of a deep canyon, himself,
Experiencing loss.
 
Serious, when the man is gone,
Tells himself that he tried,
Tells himself that he cried and cried
For all he was worth
To the man sitting on the other side
Experiencing loss,
Who one day simply vanished, or moved on,
Or slipped off the edge of the earth
And died.
 
 
12.
Serious doesn’t speak French.
This embarrasses Serious,
Because insofar as he lives anywhere,
Serious lives in Paris.
 
He feels the city stare,
Feels himself sweat, and shake, as he tries to wrench
The little that he’s gleaned
Into the lot that he desires;
Feels shopkeepers look at him as if he were a liar,
Waiters as if he were unclean;
 
And feels, in truth, not at all serious,
As if he had a huge balloon for a head
And helium squeaks for a voice,
As if gravity could be merely a choice
He were making, and he might instead
Simply stop, let go, and drift away.
 
Finally Serious, opposed to epiphanies,
Has one he can’t resist.
He is Serious, and to be Serious
Is to know something utterly or not at all,
And to know, moreover,
That as you let your half-knowledge fall
From you, it does not exist.
 
Just like that Serious is himself again,
Saying weighty things
About the flowers in the stalls,
Pondering a splendid mirage
Called the Seine.
 
And if he wakes saying fromage,
Or in some shop feels
Right on the verge of translating please,
Serious knows it’s a dream,
And knows from childhood what to do.
Point and scream
Until the damn fools give you cheese.
 
 
13.
Serious has some culture.
He knows some things.
And if, as he begins to speak,
He should feel the immense wings
Of ignorance shadowing him, that dirty vulture
That squawks in drawl and drips tobacco juice,
Serious knows what shelter to seek.
 
Pick a name and Bach is better.
Modernism was powerful but diffuse.
Life’s drained out of pictures since the Renaissance.
Technique! Technique! Technique!
And about all that spastic flatulence
Called contemporary art,
Well, Serious hardly knows where to start.
 
Serious sits through opera without a yawn,
Chews up books on which weaker teeth would shatter;
He can tell you where one brushstroke lies,
List the reasons courtly love is gone,
Pluck the speck of subject matter
From Henry James.
Serious knows some things.
 
He thinks and thinks and thinks
Until his ignorance shrinks
To the tiniest of flies
Alighting somewhere in the Louvre.
Carefully, carefully, Serious creeps
With his massive swatter,
Saying, Don’t move. Don’t move.
 
 
14.
Serious believes in nothing.
It’s a nice day, what should we do?
What are you thinking?
What’s been bothering you?
What’s that you’re drinking?
 
Serious spreads the paper on his lap
To confirm what’s new under the sun,
Hears a tap, tap, tap 
Against the windowpane.
 Nothing ventured, nothing gained,
Floats up from childhood like a bit of ash,
And Serious, pausing, can almost see
His old preacher, that atom bomb of idiocy
Who every Sunday would explode.
Still, Serious thinks, there’s a truth to set you free.
But who could survive the blast?
 Tap, tap, tap.
 
Serious skims the sports pages,
Reads about a storm that rages
Far out at sea.
Some talking dog is taking office,
Some country wiping out monuments, expunging its past.
 Tap, tap, tap.
 Goddammit, Serious says, midway through a war,
And thinks again of that old bore
Who talked and talked and talked
Until you felt your head loll and sway
Like some huge flower on a tiny stalk
That one good breeze would break;
 
And how you’d see him afterwards eating chicken fried steak,
Chicken fried man,
With a tiny transistor radio in his hand
So he could listen to the football game;
And how his face seethed and writhed with what seemed pain
If he saw you coming to his booth,
And he stared off as if some great truth
Were finally, finally coming clear in that chicken fried brain
And like a prophet he was going to stand up and shout—
Until what plopped innocuously out
Was your own name.
 Tap, tap, tap.
 
Serious puts aside the news of the day
And walks to the only window there is.
But there’s no wind, not even the grass stirs.
And anyway, there’s no tree.
Serious shrugs and turns away.
Must just be me.
 
 
13.
Serious sees a child
In the playground across the street,
Sees his huge stupid head and huge stupid feet
As he tries to keep up with the games,
And hears his sonar screams
Of delight amid the other children's screams,
And hears his timid weeping when they call him names.
 
Serious sees the child standing apart sometimes
Driveling to himself in silly rhymes,
And sees him pretend to look intently at the sky
If Serious walks by,
Or sees him simply stop and stare.
 
Gradually Serious starts seeing the child everywhere,
In a store standing in an aisle,
In the subway while
Serious is trying to work on the way home,
Or laughing with his family in a restaurant
Where Serious eats alone.
 
Serious knows the truth.
This child wants something, his whole nature is want.
And it begins to be annoying,
This novice cringing, all the imbecilic and cloying
Tactics of being cute,
The whole hangdog way he has of panhandling pity
With his freckles and his missing tooth,
Sitting all fidgety in his Sunday suit
Or babbling happily as he’s leaking snot;
 
And then the air he suddenly puts on of being serious
When it’s so obvious he’s not.
 
Serious sees the child in the playground
Standing to the side,
Sees his face whiten and his eyes go wide
As Serious crosses the street and strides
Until his shadow swallows the child
And leans down close enough for them to kiss.I don’t have time for this,
Serious says,I’ve got too much to do.
 
And the child says, Who are you?
 
 
16.
Serious kills himself.No, no,
Shivering out of a dream,
Starlight and the hard glitter
Under the bridge’s beam,
Serious, Serious,
Don’t go.
 
Serious crawls out of bed,
Feels the cold in the floor
And thinks, suddenly, of lovely Mad
(Where can she be?)
Who’d bolt out of sleep and screamFarmers get up at four!
It’s three.
 
Serious makes himself a cup of coffee,
Which he doesn’t drink;
Tries and fails to read,
Tries and fails to think.
Serious sits, and holds himself still,
Minute by minute;
Until the dawn finally comes
And he is in it.
 
 
17.
Serious lives alone.
It’s better this way, he tells himself,
As he takes a pan from the pan shelf,
A spatula from the spatula drawer,
And fries two eggs the way he likes them:
Yolks of stone.
 
No more gnats of chatter over breakfast.
No more breakfast. It’s noon.
No one prancing by with only panties on
When he’s almost, almost broken through,
Or singsonging outside his doorSerious, O Serious, where are you?
No more!
 
But what, finally, does Serious do?
He sits, ignores the ringing phone,
Looks at a wall
On one of the last warm days of the year,
And settles back into the lifelong call
Of being serious,
Which is to see, within that whiteness,
Leaves being gently blown,
And to feel their colors as they fall.
 
 
18.
Serious gives a speech.
He sets his papers on the podium,
His glass within easy reach,Tap, tap, taps the microphone.
How vast this venue is.
How absolute this darkness.
 To be serious is to be alone!
Serious cries out with a triumphant look on his face,
Waiting for the echoes to end
Out there in all that space,
Which the words at once define and extend.
It takes a while, but they do die.
The spotlight lasers in.
He blinks hard, starts again.
 To know in every hand another’s touch, To hear a silence words only intensify, To feel not too little but too much This attenuated world—
 
Serious begins to sweat,
Feels the back of his shirt grow wet;
Looks down to see his papers swirled
And scattered, the glass on the floor, broken.
What’s with this fucking light, he thinks,
Or was it spoken?
He glares out at the dark, impassive crowd
And as if by force he could make them wake
Hears his voice growing loud:
 Whatever you most treasure you will break, Whatever you hold closest you will let go, There is no place that you will not leave! But to be serious—
                                  Serious says,
Quietly now, because he has them, they are his—
 To be serious, to be truly serious, is to know That what you call your losses you cannot grieve, For it was never quite these things that you wanted—This treasure, this touch, this one place—But by such life to be haunted.
 
Brilliant!
No notes, no flaws.
Serious stands back and waits for applause.
The hall is silent, utterly silent,
The heat tropic.
 
Serious looks around, confused,
Turns to the man who introduced him
Then can’t remember being introduced;
And even given his credentials,
This suddenly seems a most unlikely topic.
 
Serious tries to get out of the light,
But the light goes where Serious goes.
He blunders to the edge of the stage,
A cliff
Breaking off into a dark
in which there's no movement, no voices, not one sigh.
 
Serious feels the rage
Draining out of him, and feels a chill, and whispers,Where am I?
 
 
19.
Serious nears an end.
It’s cold and getting colder,
And Serious, older,
Sits outside thinking of his good friend,
Who like so much of Serious is gone,
And thinking of that godforsaken dawn
After the one night of his life he spent outdoors.
 Tell me,
His good friend said
When Serious staggered out to the fire,Which form would you say is higher,Tragedy or comedy?
 
And Serious, who had stumbled full-bladdered
In the night from a dream of bears,
Then dreamed himself the object
Of a dozen hungry stares,
Who had swiveled, pissed into the tent,
And sworn such things it would take a life to repent,
Serious, exhausted Serious,
Was silent.
 Because it’s been troubling me,Serious, that the answer can only be tragedy.To be conscious is to be conscious ofLosing whatever it is that you most love,And thus an art that's truly greatWill always have one deepest truth to tell,Which is, my friend, this life is hell.
 
Serious looks at the sky. It’s late.
A small wind blows
The trees, and Serious, shivering, knows
He should head inside,
That he is not well.
But sitting here, letting his eyes close,
Serious can almost see that lake
Aflame with the early sun, and smell
The sweet burn of that wood,
And feel the way it seemed his heart would surely break
Were it not for the strange lightness in his head
As his friend smiled and said,But maybe earth is the heaven of the good.
 
 
20.
Serious talks to God.
There’s no one else left.
His mind is mash,
His world is ash,
And Serious occasionally forgets himself,
Though he is not, not Bereft,
That sniveling idiot two doors down
Who sits up late
With only ashes in the grate
And talks to God.
 See? Serious says. See?Nothing.
Serious spreads his arms magnanimously
As if to give God the floor.
God declines.Thou know’st the first time that we smell the airWe wawl and cry,
Serious says, louder than before.And then we wawl and cry some more,And then we die,And then we rot!
Again he waits in case
There’s disagreement. There’s not.
 
Serious scoffs, goes to brush his teeth,
Forgets briefly to avert his eye
From the mirror’s glare
And finds his father there,
 
That gentle baffled man
Who, when there was no hope,
When he couldn’t even stand,
Carved from a piece of soap
A silly yellow duck
And set it in a little yellow dish.
Serious feels a tingling in his hair
And mutters something close to a prayer,I wish, I wish...
 
The lights go out.Goddammit, Serious shouts
As he trips and falls
To his knees on the floor,
Banging his head on the door
As he tries to rise.GodDAMMIT! Serious cries.
 
The lights come on.
His father’s gone,
But there, at the edge of the sink,
Balances the little duck in the little dish
No serious person would ever keep.
Serious tries to think,
Steadies himself as if at some brink,
Decides he needs sleep,
That’s what he needs,
Crawling fully clothed into his bed
And pulling the covers to his chin
Because, it seems, there’s some strange wind
 
That’s somehow gotten inside.
So unlike Serious,
To leave a door unclosed.
 
Yet here it is, gathering strength
As it blows his books
On the floor and it blows
Right through his body and it blows
Behind and below and above
And out of the whirlwind a voice cries
 
                    Love
 What? Serious says, as he tries
To sit upright and looks
Wildly around him,
Raising his fist in the air.The things...I have lost—
 
Immediately he is tossed
Back against the wall
By the force of a storm
That has no source, no form,
And hears again the call
Out of nowhere:
 
                    Love
 My God! Serious screams,
Unable to help himself,What maundering politician,What decerebrated pop star, What stupid puling poet Couldn’t tell me that? 
Struggling to get out of bed
He starts to cough, then choke,
A riot in his heart,
A riot in his head
As he falls off the edge to the floor.Who do you think you are, 
He gasps. Is this... Is this some sort of JOKE?
 
Suddenly the strange wind is quiet,
But no less strange the calm that comes after.
 I’m serious, the voice says.
 
And Serious dies of laughter.
 
 
EPILOGUE
The dead man’s famous.
No one now remembers him alive,
Or knows his name, or anything he did.
Still, a few stories survive
After all this while
Of a weird-looking man
With a weird-looking smile
That had, it’s said,
Almost a kind of life to it,
Though the man was seriously dead.
 
And some remember how all the flies
Vanished for miles;
And some say no, no, but the buzzards had weird smiles
As if they knew something.
And some tell of an old woman
Who would come and whisper in the dead man’s ear,
And smooth the dead man’s hair,
And if the door opened, disappear.
There are even stories of that grim mortician
Who thought the smile undignified
And tugged and tugged so hard
He slipped and fell inside
Right on top of the dead man,
Whose lips, he swore, seemed to soften,
Seemed to somehow kiss.
And some remember this:
Before the lid was sealed on that coffin
And the nails driven,
There were on that face real tears.
And some say he smiled like a man forgiven.
 
The dead man never hears.
The dead man spins and spins
With his dumb dolphin grin
Through all the places where he is
When people talk of him again:
In classrooms or in planes,
In boredom or in pain;
In front of screens
Or in the spotlight’s glare;
In days too mild to bear
And in the long nights where
The dark grows steep,
The wind wild,
And a mother rises from her sleep
To calm her serious child.

Somebody or somethingI read once said that when Jesus had his visionof what his father, God, would do to him,that Jesus could only see pieces of a cross,pieces of a body appearing through flashesof sun, as if the body in his visionwas hands looking for feet, a head for a torso,everything come unmagnetized from the soul:the lion caught me in his stare not ator through me but fixated on the great chainof being that Jesus couldn’t see and thata zebra might gallop in — black and white stripesmarking longitudes of this world turningto meat, bloody meat — this vision of an inmatethat Jesus’s father helped to orchestrate bymaking a cageless cage with glass insteadof bars — though the lion didn’t seem to care,he was roaring for his keepers to bringhim food, so everything’s what it should beif you’re a lion. Nor did the sea lionseem concerned about having gone a littlecrazy, barking incessantly so I could seethe plush, hot pink insides of its throat,though like the lion through the glassthere’s this distortion, my reflectionI’m looking through that makes me float abovethe zoo: and now this silence at closing timepours like a waterfall in different zonesof silences that, pouring through my head,surround roaring, barking, human muttering — is any of that what being sounds like?Or is it just animal gasping like whatJesus must have heard from the thieveshanging beside him, one damned, one saved?What was in his heart when his visionclarified and he saw it was a hand herecognized that the nail was driving through?

It’s not enough to cover the rock with leaves  — as if  vernal fluidities could be enough for the stern assault of  fact. As if  a living ornament, light and subject to temporal  breezes, could be enough to overcome despair, that chunk of  something solid in the air, unmoving, as words repeated are. It’s not enough to cover despair with motion. Motion itself  is flawed, continuous motion a narrow, thin escape from what is rooted. Leaves do sway, but in truth, they’re only flapping out, ancillary, uncertain, buffeted this way and that. They remain the fact they are bound to, involuntary notions victim to the weather of  a day, gripped by what has thrust between the rocks, flexible as everything not rock is, reckless as imagining is reckless.

He snapped his lighter shut, placed it beside the metronome
on his nightstand. We’d just made love and I was
sitting naked on the edge of his bed, watching the stars
appear. He told me my skin was chatoyant
in the window light, like wet fiddleback maple. I asked him
what chatoyant meant. He grinned and explained
growth distortion, how it could pattern the wood fibers
into flames of alternating tones. I told him
that was nice and he said he could take me to the workshop
for a look around. Show me what he was talking
about. I rolled my eyes. It sounded so boring. But then
he bit into my thigh and said he wanted to
fashion me into a beautiful cello. He drove with both hands
on the wheel and told me he thought of everyone
as instruments. He said his father was filled with knots
like a burl and only good for music boxes
but his mother was quilted beneath her surface, like rippled
river water. Then he just stared ahead at the road
and kept quiet the rest of the way. When we got inside
he felt along the wall and flipped a switch
so I could see the three white torsos, each with a headstock
and fretboard attached to the sternum. They were
displayed on hangers like guitars. I covered my mouth
with a shaking hand, backed away and ran
out to the parking lot. He stood at the door and watched me
squeal away in his pickup. The sky clouded over

off the trunk of a black walnut tree, then sliced into a veneer.

drained it of blood and gave me back my luggage.
I signed the register in my own name
for the first time in my life of low celebrity.
In the lounge bar, there were pictures by Margarita
but no sign of margaritas by the pitcher.
All night, the couple in the next-door room
failed noisily to make love even once.
The signature tune of the air conditioning
was a surface B-side for any one-hit-wonder.
Weary, I ordered up the late night menu
from room service, but sleep wasn’t on it
so, after an hour of mentally undressing myself,
I donned the pyjamas with the killer bee motif
and there on the bed I wrote a dozen
identical postcards to friends I’d forgotten.
No doubt to keep the cold tap company,
the hot tap had opted to be a cold tap too.
Funnel-web spiders wove their lazy way
toward each other across the scarlet ceiling
and when I solved the riddle of the shower,
no blood came gushing, but no water either.
By the bed, a Gideon Bible in Esperanto
and a phone-book listing Lumsdens of the world;
in the mini-bar, flat Vimto and a half-pint
of someone else’s mother’s milk, turned to fur.
The TV had one channel, showing highlights
from my worst performances in every sphere.
At three, in the courtyard, a chambermaid choir
sang a barbershop version of ‘I Will Survive’.
The only time I dared to close my eyes,
dervishes under the bed began to talk dirty.

la herradura, s.v.—¿Do I have a mother? Have her pinkie in my hand crossing the street? Have her breath on my hair as she sings arru-rru mi niño to sleep. ¿Don’t you mean where? ¿What was your question? I’m older. Think more about memory. It makes me crazy. Obsessed. Her warm breasts on my belly as she knelt to tell me todo va estar bien. I’ll never see her again was the fear as if she’s gone, died, will never come back. I whispered it hidden in banana groves looking at the sky hoping one of those planes would take me to wherever she had left to. Whenever Mom hung the clothes to dry, not a cloud in the sky. I could see her sandals picking up dust. For a second. For a second I believe she’s back. It went like that every day. Every single night.  I’ll never see her again. But then, I did. Her face. Her hair. She was the same. So much had changed. I do not remember  what it was I truly felt.

my bits and pieces making a home from home.
I pray to the rain-clouds that they never come
where their lost father lies; that their mother thrives;
     and that I
may measure up to them
before I die.
 
Soon a new year
will be here demanding, as before,
modest proposals, resolute resolutions, a new leaf,
new leaves. This is the story of my life,
the story of all lives everywhere,
mad fools whatever we are,
in here or out there.

                    Devotion: The Burnt-Over District
                ","
Late fall in the villages of Pompey, Preble, Oran, Delphi Falls,        churched river and woods. In Homer and Ovid, the localities        and principalities of central New York, the hollows and corners of the        burnt-over districts visited by angels in the 1800's who led us to greatness: awakenings, gold, portents and lies, heaven, women's suffrage, and bundling with the other in the love beds while we waited for the lamb,  the dove, the velvet of the ten-point buck grunting through        the underbrush to rut. We learned in divine time a year's a day.        We learned obedience and had charismatic children. And now the boy's an angelic eighteen days or six thousand years, as he leaves to serve. He did what we told him: blocked for punts—no one likes to        block for punts— and when his friends crashed the truck in a ditch, he waited        for the cops and took the rap, nice kid, because he did the act of deliverance        one does in central New York and made the vows, pledged, testified,        and swore and participated in the sport greater than the coming of the dead, and escorted the exaggerated girl to the prom where he        was befuddled with organza and tulle and he did not forget the corsage, an orchid in a box he stared into: the white outer whorl and the inner whorl and pouted purple lip. He butterflied the pollen with the lashes        of his eyes. The flower was his terror. He was not meant to be the        indwelling beauty of things and surely he was not meant to be the wind in Iraq        with three others in his division and become the abstract shape of a god formed from a blood clot. I've seen the pictures, the vague shapes that ripple in the heat until I was terrified. It looked like he still moved. Remember fall in Delphi? All ardent and catastrophic and counter, elbows flailing, he ran in the flat places scraped from the gold hills and valleys.

When he was four years old, he stood at the window during a
    thunderstorm. His father, a tailor, sat on the table sewing.
    He came up to his father and said, “I know what makes
    thunder: two clouds knock together.”
When he was older, he recited well-known rants at parties.
    They all said that he would be a lawyer.
At law school he won a prize for an essay. Afterwards, he
    became the chum of an only son of rich people. They   
    were said to think the world of the young lawyer.   
The Appellate Division considered the matter of his disbarment.
    His relatives heard rumours of embezzlement.
When a boy, to keep himself at school, he had worked in a   
    drug store.
Now he turned to this half-forgotten work, among perfumes
    and pungent drugs, quiet after the hubble-bubble of the
    courts and the search in law books.
He had just enough money to buy a drug store in a side
    street.
Influenza broke out. The old tailor was still keeping his shop
    and sitting cross-legged on the table sewing, but he was
    half-blind.
He, too, was taken sick. As he lay in bed he thought, “What a
    lot of money doctors and druggists must be making; now
    is my son’s chance.”
They did not tell him that his son was dead of influenza.

It appears that we’re living (which isn’t always the case), dependingon how one defines such things, in a “now you see it / now you see it” kind of way. We can say we’re working on our age,as well, listening to Bob Dylan songs where people can agein whatever direction supports the theme. “Too bad life doesn’tget themes,” Robin says, and yes, that’s right, and then we can all go do whatever it was we were going to do anyway. “It’s either that,or pay off the kidnapper,” as Neil Young had it, back in the mid-70s.There’s always an analogue, and someone to tell us about it,how, no matter how fast you run, you can’t run fast enoughto get away from yourself. You could even call it a theme.For instance, I was the first one to an eighteen-wheeler accidenton the highway once, in the early 90s. I didn’t know whatI was going to find. It was just tossed there on its side, acrossboth lanes. So I got out of the car and walked around to the front,only to see the driver standing inside the cab that was restingon the driver-side door. He was simply standing there behind the glass,parallel with the dashboard, a little blood on his forehead, lookingas lost as I felt, looking back at him. All his things (magazinesand maps and cigarettes and pens and snacks) in a little pile at his feet.When I left, a guy was hitting the windshield with a baseball bat.You go to the room, and the place you like to sitis missing. This is an opportunity to trust, I suppose, or perhapsfor blind panic, if one were to consider this a metaphorfor something. But say it’s not, say there are no such thingsas metaphors for a moment, and where does that get you?Presently, it gets me to a row of green and yellow plastic chairs,those 1950s-looking ones I imagine Kenton would liketo collect. They’re joined together by shiny metal clasps, chrome,and the whole thing is full of sunlight through the plate glasswindow. It’s the kind of scene I think of as lickable, how everything looks like cheerful candy, and I wonder if there might be a wayto be there or here without a beginning, or without an ending,or if perhaps there might be a concept for no middle.

Rose of fate, you looked for ways to wound us
yet you bent like the secret about to be released
and the command you chose to give us was beautiful
and your smile was like a ready sword.
The ascent of your cycle livened creation
from your thorn emerged the way’s thought
our impulse dawned naked to possess you
the world was easy: a simple pulsation.

The secrets of the sea are forgotten on the shores

motion. . . you touched the tree with the apples

O dark shivering in the roots and the leaves

May lilies blossom again on the meadow of separation
may days open mature, the embrace of the heavens,
may those eyes alone shine in the glare
the pure soul be outlined like the song of a flute.
Was it night that shut its eyes? Ashes remain,
as from the string of a bow a choked hum remains,
ash and dizziness on the black shore
and dense fluttering imprisoned in surmise.
Rose of the wind, you knew but took us unknowing
at a time when thought was building bridges
so that fingers would knit and two fates pass by
and spill into the low and rested light.
          III
O dark shivering in the roots and the leaves!
Come forth sleepless form in the gathering silence
raise your head from your cupped hands
so that your will be done and you tell me again
the words that touched and merged with the blood like an embrace;
and let your desire, deep like the shade of a walnut tree, bend
and flood us with your lavish hair
from the down of the kiss to the leaves of the heart.
You lowered your eyes and you had the smile
that masters of another time humbly painted.
Forgotten reading from an ancient gospel,
your words breathed and your voice was gentle:
‘The passing of time is soft and unworldly
and pain floats lightly in my soul
dawn breaks in the heavens, the dream remains afloat
and it’s as if scented shrubs were passing.
‘With my eyes’ startling, with my body’s blush
a flock of doves awakens and descends
their low, circling flight entangles me
the stars are a human touch on my breast.
‘I hear, as in a sea shell, the distant
adverse and confused lament of the world
but these are moments only, they disappear,
and the two-branched thought of my desire reigns alone.
‘It seemed I’d risen naked in a vanished recollection
when you came, strange and familiar, my beloved
to grant me, bending, the boundless deliverance
I was seeking from the wind’s quick sistrum. . .’
The broken sunset declined and was gone
and it seemed a delusion to ask for the gifts of the sky.
You lowered your eyes. The moon’s thorn blossomed
and you became afraid of the mountain’s shadows.

It is to Emerson I have turned now,
damp February, for he has written
of the moral harmony of nature.
The key to every man is his thought.
But Emerson, half angel, suffers his
dear Ellen’s dying only half-consoled
that her lungs shall no more be torn nor her
head scalded by her blood, nor her whole life
suffer from the warfare between the force
& delicacy of her soul & the
weakness of her frame . . . March the 29th,
1832, of an evening strange
with dreaming, he scribbles, I visited
Ellen’s tomb & opened the coffin.
—Emerson looking in, clutching his key.
Months of hard freeze have ruptured the wild
fields of Ohio, and burdock is standing
as if stunned by persistent cold wind
or leaning over, as from rough breath.
I have brought my little one, bundled and
gloved, to the lonely place to let her run,
hoary whiskers, wild fescue, cracks widened
along the ground hard from a winter drought.
I have come out for the first time in weeks
still full of fever, insomnia-fogged,
to track her flags of breath where she’s dying
to vanish on the hillsides of bramble
and burr. The seasonal birds—scruff cardinal,
one or two sparrows, something with yellow—
scatter in small explosions of ice.
Emerson, gentle mourner, would be pleased
by the physical crunch of the ground, damp
from the melt, shaped by the shape of his boot,
that half of him who loved the Dunscore heath
too rocky to cultivate, covered thick
with heather, gnarled hawthorn, the yellow furze
not far from Carlyle’s homestead where they strolled,
—that half of him for whom nature was thought.
Kate has found things to deepen her horror
for evenings to come, a deer carcass tunneled
by slugs, drilled, and abandoned, a bundle
of bone shards, hoof and hide, hidden by thick
bramble, or the bramble itself enough
to collapse her dreams, braided like rope, blood-
colored, blood-barbed, tangled as Medusa.
What does she see when she looks at such things?
I do not know what is so wrong with me
that my body has erupted, system
by system, sick unto itself. I do
not know what I have done, nor what she thinks
when she turns toward her ill father. How did
Emerson behold of his Ellen, un-
embalmed face fallen in, of her white hands?
Dreams & beasts are two keys by which we are
to find out the secrets of our own natures.
Half angel, Emerson wrestles all night
with his journal, the awful natural
fact of Ellen’s death, which must have been
deeper sacrifice than a sacrament.
Where has she gone now, whose laughter comes down
like light snow on the beautiful hills?
Perhaps it is the world that is the matter . . .
—His other half worried by the wording.

If I were to ask you a question about your book
and sum it up into one word it would be, Why?
I think I like Walt Whitman better than you. I just don't
get literature, but for a fast hour and a half read, your book
 
takes the cake. I like how you organized the lines
in that one poem to represent a growing twisting bonsai tree.
Are you going to get a rude reaction when you meet
that one guy in that one poem? I guess you never know.
 
You are very young to be a poet. I also like how your poems take
up an entire page (it makes our reading assignment go faster).
In class we spend so much time dissecting your poems
and then deeply analyzing them. I think I like Walt Whitman
 
better than you, but don’t take offense—you are very good too!
You are young, You are young and pure and really just want
to have a good time. Thank you we have taken a debate
and you are a far better poet than Walt Whitman. And I loved
 
how your poems were easy to read and understand. Hello
my name is Alicia. We read you book and I just loved it.
We also read Walt Whitman’s Leaves of Grass. There
was no competition there. I liked your book a whole lot better.
 
It was an easy read. But poetry is not my favorite type
of literature. Sometimes I am offered drinks and guys
try to talk to me but I too just brush it off and keep dancing.
Every once and a while the creepy mean guys try to offer you
 
things and then they say something. What would you do?
Lastly, I was wondering if you ever wrote a poem that really
didn’t have a deeper meaning but everyone still tried
to give it one anyways? Walt Whitman is better than you.

They shall not return to us, the resolute, the young,     The eager and whole-hearted whom we gave: But the men who left them thriftily to die in their own dung,     Shall they come with years and honour to the grave? They shall not return to us, the strong men coldly slain     In sight of help denied from day to day: But the men who edged their agonies and chid them in their pain,     Are they too strong and wise to put away? Our dead shall not return to us while Day and Night divide—    Never while the bars of sunset hold. But the idle-minded overlings who quibbled while they died,     Shall they thrust for high employments as of old? Shall we only threaten and be angry for an hour?     When the storm is ended shall we find How softly but how swiftly they have sidled back to power     By the favour and contrivance of their kind? Even while they soothe us, while they promise large amends,     Even while they make a show of fear, Do they call upon their debtors, and take counsel with their friends,     To conform and re-establish each career? Their lives cannot repay us—their death could not undo—     The shame that they have laid upon our race. But the slothfulness that wasted and the arrogance that slew,     Shall we leave it unabated in its place?

I
Swear by what the Sages spoke   
Round the Mareotic Lake
That the Witch of Atlas knew,   
Spoke and set the cocks a-crow.
Swear by those horsemen, by those women,   
Complexion and form prove superhuman,   
That pale, long visaged company
That airs an immortality
Completeness of their passions won;   
Now they ride the wintry dawn
Where Ben Bulben sets the scene.
Here's the gist of what they mean.   
II
Many times man lives and dies   
Between his two eternities,   
That of race and that of soul,   
And ancient Ireland knew it all.   
Whether man dies in his bed   
Or the rifle knocks him dead,
A brief parting from those dear   
Is the worst man has to fear.   
Though grave-diggers' toil is long,   
Sharp their spades, their muscle strong,   
They but thrust their buried men   
Back in the human mind again.
III
You that Mitchel's prayer have heard   
`Send war in our time, O Lord!'   
Know that when all words are said   
And a man is fighting mad,   
Something drops from eyes long blind   
He completes his partial mind,   
For an instant stands at ease,   
Laughs aloud, his heart at peace,   
Even the wisest man grows tense   
With some sort of violence   
Before he can accomplish fate   
Know his work or choose his mate.
IV
Poet and sculptor do the work   
Nor let the modish painter shirk   
What his great forefathers did,   
Bring the soul of man to God,   
Make him fill the cradles right.
Measurement began our might:   
Forms a stark Egyptian thought,   
Forms that gentler Phidias wrought.
Michael Angelo left a proof   
On the Sistine Chapel roof,   
Where but half-awakened Adam   
Can disturb globe-trotting Madam   
Till her bowels are in heat,   
Proof that there's a purpose set   
Before the secret working mind:   
Profane perfection of mankind.
Quattrocento put in paint,
On backgrounds for a God or Saint,   
Gardens where a soul's at ease;   
Where everything that meets the eye
Flowers and grass and cloudless sky   
Resemble forms that are, or seem   
When sleepers wake and yet still dream,   
And when it's vanished still declare,   
With only bed and bedstead there,   
That Heavens had opened.
                                        Gyres run on;
When that greater dream had gone   
Calvert and Wilson, Blake and Claude   
Prepared a rest for the people of God,   
Palmer's phrase, but after that
Confusion fell upon our thought.
V
Irish poets learn your trade   
Sing whatever is well made,   
Scorn the sort now growing up   
All out of shape from toe to top,
Their unremembering hearts and heads   
Base-born products of base beds.   
Sing the peasantry, and then   
Hard-riding country gentlemen,   
The holiness of monks, and after   
Porter-drinkers' randy laughter;   
Sing the lords and ladies gay   
That were beaten into the clay   
Through seven heroic centuries;   
Cast your mind on other days   
That we in coming days may be   
Still the indomitable Irishry.

Wasn’t he?’ said the Dean. ‘His son’s here now.’   
Death-suited, visitant, I nod. ‘And do
You keep in touch with—’ Or remember how   
Black-gowned, unbreakfasted, and still half-tight   
We used to stand before that desk, to give   
‘Our version’ of ‘these incidents last night’?   
I try the door of where I used to live:
Locked. The lawn spreads dazzlingly wide.
A known bell chimes. I catch my train, ignored.   
Canal and clouds and colleges subside
Slowly from view. But Dockery, good Lord,   
Anyone up today must have been born
In ’43, when I was twenty-one.
If he was younger, did he get this son
At nineteen, twenty? Was he that withdrawn
High-collared public-schoolboy, sharing rooms
With Cartwright who was killed? Well, it just shows   
How much ... How little ... Yawning, I suppose
I fell asleep, waking at the fumes
And furnace-glares of Sheffield, where I changed,   
And ate an awful pie, and walked along   
The platform to its end to see the ranged   
Joining and parting lines reflect a strong
Unhindered moon. To have no son, no wife,   
No house or land still seemed quite natural.   
Only a numbness registered the shock   
Of finding out how much had gone of life,   
How widely from the others. Dockery, now:   
Only nineteen, he must have taken stock
Of what he wanted, and been capable
Of ... No, that’s not the difference: rather, how
Convinced he was he should be added to!
Why did he think adding meant increase?
To me it was dilution. Where do these
Innate assumptions come from? Not from what   
We think truest, or most want to do:
Those warp tight-shut, like doors. They’re more a style   
Our lives bring with them: habit for a while,
Suddenly they harden into all we’ve got
And how we got it; looked back on, they rear   
Like sand-clouds, thick and close, embodying   
For Dockery a son, for me nothing,
Nothing with all a son’s harsh patronage.   
Life is first boredom, then fear.
Whether or not we use it, it goes,
And leaves what something hidden from us chose,   
And age, and then the only end of age.

2  The Miniature Bed

not sleeping, not able to sleep because
a small lie has flowered between them,
fragile as a new, white crocus.
The miniature bed holds them like a miniature boat
making its slow, true course to morning.
These tiny people, thoughts thrumming like mice,
are quiet as the lie blooms over them
in the night, fanning its moth petals,
becoming to them like a moon hovering
over their bed, a moon they might almost touch
with their miniature hands, if they weren't certain
that one wrong gesture might break
the spindles of their small world, if their hearts
were not drops of trembling quicksilver,
if they were brave, if they could see
that small is no smaller than big, that thimbles
are deep as oceans for any god, they might even
touch each other then, opening the dark,

3  Harvest
 
The fields are a book of uses.
Near the house
a combine takes the corn down
in long rows.
Dust rises up and replaces itself.
A quick net of starlings
drops to the furrows
and sunshine pours like polished grain
onto the feeding earth,
this country.
 
In the kitchen, milk streams
from the gallon
thin and fresh as luck.
We flourish.
All around us, things flourish.
Cows strain the fence with their abundance.
The herd makes a sound like swelling.
 
Out in the cut field
birds clean the fallen cobs
into sets of teeth.     
4  Sonnet for Lost Teeth
 
The combines were tearing off the field’s clothes.
It was August, haying season. My tooth
was loose, a snag in the clam of my mouth.
I worked it like a pearl. I'd been out of school
for sixty days. In the sweat of the barn
I watched him shoot the calf in the head.
He wiped the hide gently, like cleaning his glasses.
Overnight, I grew a beard so I wouldn't
have to get married. I let my feet go black
from burned grasses. It never gets easier

She went down so quiet it was almost

wrap your fingers around

Half of everything is invisible.
A river drifts below the river.
A gesture lost in the body.
Wind moves through the open
windows of the trees.

Each year fish run the green vein of the river.
The bones of skunks lie buried in the riverbank
upside down, waiting for rain.
 
From a fragment of a Greek statue
you can tell the posture of the whole god.
A skeleton has the same intelligence.

loosened by summer rain, surfaced
like a white instrument in the grass,
she suddenly knows how to take it up
and shake the strange rhythms from it like castanets.     
8  A Childhood
 
The horse had been beaten and flies
crawled excited on the beat marks.
He held still in the sunblazed pasture.
For a few minutes I stood at the wire fence.
He was aware of me, but he did not turn—
except his eye, slightly. He listened
through the many ears of the grasses.
A jay made a hole in the air with its cry.
Everywhere, invisible as heat, the gods
married each other and went to war.
The excitement of it vibrated in the flies.
As if we both were standing still
inside some greater, more violent motion.

It was a transmogrifying bee

I
        after the immigration raid
Beneath one apple tree the fruit
lies flung like the beads from
a rosary with a broken string.
Another tree stands amused
over the strangeness of a shoe
that pretends to be an apple
in its redness, though it'll never be
an apple with that lace stem
and a pit where a core should be.
The tree at the end of the row
will weep over the pillage
all week. Around its trunk, debris:
straw hats, handkerchief, a basket
going hungry for what's out
of reach. Somewhere in the orchard
a screech goes weaker by the hour.
A radio without paws, it cannot claw
its chords to end its suffering.
But silence comes, eventually,
and the apple trees will rest,
gathering the shadows to their roots
as the flame inside each apple
falls asleep. All the while, finches
perch among the branches—patient
vultures waiting for the fruit to rot.
For a wasp, intoxicated by the sugars,
this is the perfect place to nest.
The colony will thrive inside
decay: the apples softening until
their wrinkled skins begin to sink,
the seeds poking through like teeth.
The trees will sway without the wind
because the ground will boil
with larvae. A bird will feast
until it chokes and ants will march
into the belly through the beak.
II
              after the ride by bus
A strand of hair pretends to be
a crack and sticks to glass. A piece
of thread sits on a seat, pretends
to be a tear. The bus makes believe
no one cried into their hands and smeared
that grief onto its walls. The walls
will keep the fingerprints a secret
until the sheen of oils glows by moon.
Rows of ghosts come forth to sing.
 
Until that keening rocks the bus
to rest, the fumes intoxicate
the solitary button—single witness
to the shuffling of feet and a final act
of fury: the yanking of a wetback's
shirt. The button popped right off
the flannel, marched in the procession
and then scurried to the side. The lesson:
if wounded, stay behind to die. 
The bus breathes out the shapes
turned silhouettes turned scent
of salt and sweat. The steering wheel
unspools, every window shaking loose
the wetness of its glare. And now
a riddle squats over the parking lot:
What creature stands its ground
after evisceration? Roadkill. Clouds
close in to consume the afterbirth.
III
              after the detention in the county jail 
A mausoleum also keeps these gems:
precipitation that hardens into diamonds
on the cobweb stems, streams of urine
that shimmer like streaks of gold.
Lights coax out the coat of polish
on the floor and what's solid softens
into water stripped of ripples. Stilled
and empty, a river that has shoved
its pebbles down its throat.
The cell holds out three drops of blood
and will barter them for company,
hungry for the smell of men again. Janitor,
border guard or detainee, it's all the same
musk of armpit, garlic breath, oils
that bubble up from crack to tailbone,
scent of semen from the foreskin,
fungus from the toes. Without takers,
the keyhole constricts in the cold.
IV              after the deportation plane falls from the sky
A red-tailed hawk breaks through
the smoke and doesn't drop the way
the bodies did when the plane
began to dive and spat pieces of its
cargo out the door. No grace, the twitching
of such a great machine. No beauty to
its blackening inside the pristine
canvas of majestic blue—a streak of rage
made by a torch and not a paintbrush.
The hawk lands on the canyon
and snaps its neck in quick response
to the vulgar cracking on the boulders,
to the shrill of metal puncturing
the canyon, to the burst of flames
that traps a nest of mice within the lair
turned furnace, burning shriek, and hair.
Stunned host of sparrows scatters.
Fume of feathers, pollution in the air.
Poison in the lungs of all that breathes.
A darkness rises. The blue absorbs it
the way it dissipates a swarm after
the crisis of a shattered hive. Heaven
shows its mercy also, swallowing
the groan that spilled out of the hill.
No signs of tragedy by dusk
except a star splayed over rock,
the reek of fumes—a disemboweled god.
V
              after the clean-up along Los Gatos Canyon
What strange flowers grow
in the shadow. Without petals
and with crooked twigs for stems.
The butterflies that pollinated them
were bits of carbon glowing
at the edge. The solitary lone wolf
spider doesn't dare to bite
the scorched caul on the canyon.
It packs its fangs for brighter lands.
The footprints drawn in black
do not match the footprints
in the orchard though they also
bear the weight of the unwanted.
The chain gang called upon to gather
the debris sang the Prison Blues
all afternoon: Inmate, deportee,
in your last attempt to flee
every bone splits into three.
VI             after the communal burial
Twenty-eight equals one
deportation bus equals one
cell in the detention center, one
plane-load of deportees, one
plunge into the canyon, one
body in the coffin although one
was a woman—sister not alone
anymore among the chaperone
of angels with wings of stone.

No papers necessary to cross

the paths between tombs
and everything pushes out
into light. No shame to be
a cherub without a nose.
The wreath will not hide
its decay. Cement displays
its injuries with no regrets.
This is the place to forget
about labor and hardship and pain.
No house left to build, no kitchen
to clean, no chair on a porch, no
children to feed. No longing left
except a wish that will never come
true: Paint us back into the blank
sky's blue. Don't forget us
like we've forgotten all of you.

His heart his wound received from my sight; My heart was wounded with his wounded heart; For as from me on him his hurt did light, So still, methought, in me his hurt did smart: Both equal hurt, in this change sought our bliss, My true love hath my heart and I have his.

Not long after you had told me, gently,
that you still grieved for your last love,
though that had ended almost a year before,
and that you could have no intimate relationship
with me, maybe not with anyone for a time,
I stopped my fork in the air with whatever hung
on the end of it that I was eating.
My throat wouldn't swallow.
I felt weak and sick, as if it were myself
that I devoured, piece by piece, as you talked away
the hopes that I had put in your lovely face.
It was the old story coming true for me once more,
though you were hardly mine. . . .
When we finished I walked you back to your car;
I don't remember having much to say.
Why would I? Buildings drifted by,
and cars, and faces. Then we arrived at the place
where, afterwards, I would never see you again,
at a parking lot near Times Square.
There I marked the sidewalk with X's
visible only to me: ""At this place
I was lost again,"" they'd say to me
when I walked there in the future.
""Dig here and find what's left of me,
or what I left behind, where X marks the spot.""
I felt like the death's-head and crossed bones
that surmount the treasure chest.
I only felt a little like gold coins and jewels.
I have signed the City with these sphinxes
—in parks, in streets, in bedrooms,
in my own apartments. And there we stood,
you and I, hemmed in by the stitches of X's
that could not hold you to me. But X's
mean kisses, I realized, as well as
what is lost: all the kisses I couldn't give you
chalked like symbols on the sidewalk.
After all, you yourself had been marked
by loss, even in your laughter that afternoon
at the show I had taken you to. Bright-eyed
and smiling in the seat beside me, you
stole my glances with your dark, dark eyes
and your long hair. I thought that I had not been
this happy in a long time with a woman
and was ready to become even more happy,
ready to do anything that you wanted
in order to please you, to see that smile come up,
not knowing what you were soon to say to me
as we dined. And when you spoke,
I felt life fall away from me. Again I felt
that I would never be happy. I felt the words
that I had wanted to say to you leaving me, rushing
out of my chest like dead air, until I had no more words
to say. I seemed to cut and swallow my food
as if it were me myself that stuck in pieces
on the end of the fork I had raised to my mouth.
Had I been chewing on my own flesh?
Self-Pity the Devourer took me by the hand
that held the fork, and once again I feasted
on all that was dark and hopeless in myself,
in lieu of all that was beautiful, desirable,
and unattainable in you. And then
I stood beside you in the lot where you
had parked your car, with the X's buzzing
in the air, sticking themselves to you
and me and the blacktop and the cars.
When you reached out to embrace me, I
moved to embrace you in return—and then came
the part that I don't want to remember,
the part I hate: I caught a glimpse of your
face as we put our arms around each other,
and your face said everything to me about
how you had wasted the afternoon, how eager
you were to speed away in your car, a mixture
of disgust and relief that the thing would soon
be over, that I would be crossed out forever
from your life—and everything that I hated
about myself, my stupid chin, my ugly nose,
my hopeless balded head, my stuck-out ears,
my wreck of a heart, crashed over me,
spinning me into the vortex of a palpable self-hate
that I have only ever let myself feel
a little bit at a time, though it is always there

I could pick anything and think of you—  This lamp, the wind-still rain, the glossy blue  My pen exudes, drying matte, upon the page.  I could choose any hero, any cause or age  And, sure as shooting arrows to the heart,  Astride a dappled mare, legs braced as far apart  As standing in silver stirrups will allow—  There you'll be, with furrowed brow  And chain mail glinting, to set me free:  One eye smiling, the other firm upon the enemy.  This post-postmodern age is all business: compact disks  And faxes, a do-it-now-and-take-no-risks  Event. Today a hurricane is nudging up the coast,  Oddly male: Big Bad Floyd, who brings a host  Of daydreams: awkward reminiscences  Of teenage crushes on worthless boys  Whose only talent was to kiss you senseless.  They all had sissy names—Marcel, Percy, Dewey;  Were thin as licorice and as chewy,  Sweet with a dark and hollow center. Floyd's  Cussing up a storm. You're bunkered in your  Aerie, I'm perched in mine  (Twin desks, computers, hardwood floors):  We're content, but fall short of the Divine.  Still, it's embarrassing, this happiness—  Who's satisfied simply with what's good for us,  When has the ordinary ever been news?  And yet, because nothing else will do  To keep me from melancholy (call it blues),  I fill this stolen time with you.

When I have seen by Time's fell hand defac'd
The rich proud cost of outworn buried age;
When sometime lofty towers I see down-ras'd
And brass eternal slave to mortal rage;
When I have seen the hungry ocean gain
Advantage on the kingdom of the shore,
And the firm soil win of the wat'ry main,
Increasing store with loss and loss with store;
When I have seen such interchange of state,
Or state itself confounded to decay;
Ruin hath taught me thus to ruminate,
That Time will come and take my love away.

But weep to have that which it fears to lose.

There’s no such thing as that we beauty call,     It is mere cozenage all;     For though some, long ago, Liked certain colors mingled so and so, That doth not tie me now from choosing new; If I a fancy take     To black and blue, That fancy doth it beauty make. ’Tis not the meat, but ’tis the appetite     Makes eating a delight;     And if I like one dish More than another, that a pheasant is; What in our watches, that in us is found: So to the height and nick     We up be wound, No matter by what hand or trick.

It is half past ten in Stonington.
The trees droop apprehensive of the heat
And the sky has turned that pale suspicious colour
That means that it cannot support more light.
Here on the terrace I and a companion
Each pretends to read. The papers say
That it is 90 in New York today.
Across the street work is going forward
On the abominable house that once I fancied,
Half, might be mine, and which was in fact the home
Of the anonymous couple I used to hear
At night arguing in their unhappy bedroom.
Now they are throwing out another wing
And the site of overlooked love is changed beyond recognition.
What will the day, what will the summer bring?
Psychic storms or calm productive doldrums?
Our neighbours are no saner than ourselves.
Perhaps it is time to give the Stones a ring
Or to complain of the view from the gallery tower
Falling like a shadow across the calm veranda
Rich with malice and the threat of accidental meeting.
This is not a house but a collection
(The largest in private hands?) of sacred objects,
A spiritual boutique where anyone,
Even the wrecker who had come to spoil,
May find himself spending more than he expected
On something he cannot quite identify.
Here the little horrors become the household gods.
For the work of love requires a rule of thumb,
Not no laws in particular but its own
Whose pseudonym, at least here and now, is pleasure:
The morning wasted in work and misquotation,
A light but leisurely lunch, then reading
Walking or just watching the sun all afternoon
Till, hungry, we draw to evening and ombre.
Who are we to thank for all of this?
The greatest favours are conferred in absence
Sometimes, as a syllable gives comfort
Dependent on the time and place and person.
When pleasure and reality occur
Is there room for extra contemplation
Or the lyrical promenade? It is enough
To know (and this is surely recognition)
That the world is spherical and perfect.
Now I wish to introduce the copper beech
We saw on our walk, English and native here as I am,
Whose shade is not the green of contemplation
But the imagination’s rich metallic colour
Wherein, under libido, we live.

When we are lost in our longings, Aurelius, already it is too late:
there is already nothing we can do. I have rarely desired an end
to my desires. We are so in love with our wanting. Last week,
though doctors were quick to repair it, a baby in India was born
grasping her own beating heart in her fist. Today, a Dumpster
arrives from Dave’s Trash Removal & I begin to fill it. I toss in
a transistor radio that hasn’t worked in years. A man walking past
asks if he can take it. Later, he returns & carries off a broken TV.
A neighbor salvages the dented gray fuse box; a girl wants a window,
a paper bag full of tangled cords. All night I listen to the wind
& the echoes of feet kicking through rubbish, like a mouse nesting
inside a drum. My older brother is dead a decade. Yet here
in its enormous gold frame is the familiar, pastel portrait
someone named Maxwell drew for our mother, an inaccurate
rendering of the two of us when we were small. I can’t look at it;
I can’t throw it away. Every change is a death, you tell yourself,turn thy thoughts now to thy life as a child. . . . One day, I tell myself,
I will shut all the doors, leave everything behind. The museum
is showing a hundred tricked-out Victorian photographs
of that other world: the hoax of floating fairies, women haunted
by ghostly blurs. Another century & still we want to believe
in what we know cannot be true. Your words, Aurelius, have found me,
but you could not. If we are disappointed, we have only ourselves
to blame: Wipe out thy imagination. We fill our hands when they are
empty. We empty ourselves when we have held too much too long.

Though I am young, and cannot tell     Either what Death or Love is well, Yet I have heard they both bear darts,     And both do aim at human hearts. And then again, I have been told     Love wounds with heat, as Death with cold; So that I fear they do but bring     Extremes to touch, and mean one thing. As in a ruin we it call     One thing to be blown up, or fall; Or to our end like way may have     By a flash of lightning, or a wave; So Love’s inflamèd shaft or brand     May kill as soon as Death’s cold hand; Except Love’s fires the virtue have     To fright the frost out of the grave.

Thy sports, thy wanderings, when a child, Were even in the sylvan wild; And all the beauty of the place Is in thy heart and on thy face.   The twilight of the trees and rocks Is in the light shade of thy locks; Thy step is as the wind, that weaves Its playful way among the leaves.   Thine eyes are springs, in whose serene And silent waters heaven is seen; Their lashes are the herbs that look On their young figures in the brook.   The forest depths, by foot unpressed, Are not more sinless than thy breast; The holy peace, that fills the air Of those calm solitudes, is there.

slammed into my chin, which hurt and even more than that,
it pissed me off, because she’s my beautiful child, but in that
button snap of a moment she was suddenly just one more person

down, but awkwardly, because of how she was also balancing
her feet on my feet as I tried to pour out a bowl of pee
from her little potty as a toothbrush dangled foaming
from my mouth. Somewhere in the mess of that morning
she’d become person enough to, in the space between us,

this should be the poem about how I’m horrified at myself,
the poem about what in ourselves we have to live with,
but in that moment which followed two years of breastfeeding
and baby-wearing and sixty-nine hours of natural childbirth
and the hemorrhaging and the uncertain operation, after which
I pumped every two hours, careful not to let the cord tangle
in the IV. Even then when she cried and no matter what
and no matter and no matter and no matter and no matter what,
I held her all night if she cried so she would not ever know
someday you’ll cry alone, but I held her and ached and leaked

Sheer, gravelled slope, where vetches straggling grow.
Look for me not when gusts of winter blow,
When at thy pane beat hands of sleet and snow;
   I would not come thy dear eyes to affray,
               If spirits walk.
But when, in June, the pines are whispering low,
And when their breath plays with thy bright hair so
      As some one's fingers once were used to play—
      That hour when birds leave song, and children pray,
Keep the old tryst, sweetheart, and thou shalt know
               If spirits walk.

","
Unto the boundless Ocean of thy beauty Runs this poor river, charged with streams of zeal: Returning thee the tribute of my duty, Which here my love, my youth, my plaints reveal. Here I unclasp the book of my charged soul, Where I have cast th'accounts of all my care: Here have I summed my sighs, here I enroll How they were spent for thee; look what they are. Look on the dear expenses of my youth, And see how just I reckon with thine eyes: Examine well thy beauty with my truth, And cross my cares ere greater sum arise. Read it sweet maid, though it be done but slightly; Who can show all his love, doth love but lightly.

Down by the salley gardens

She passed the salley gardens

But I, being young and foolish,

                ","
Under yonder beech-tree single on the green-sward,
    Couched with her arms behind her golden head,Knees and tresses folded to slip and ripple idly,
    Lies my young love sleeping in the shade.Had I the heart to slide an arm beneath her,
    Press her parting lips as her waist I gather slow,Waking in amazement she could not but embrace me:
    Then would she hold me and never let me go?Shy as the squirrel and wayward as the swallow,
    Swift as the swallow along the river's lightCircleting the surface to meet his mirrored winglets,
    Fleeter she seems in her stay than in her flight.Shy as the squirrel that leaps among the pine-tops,
    Wayward as the swallow overhead at set of sun,She whom I love is hard to catch and conquer,
    Hard, but O the glory of the winning were she won!When her mother tends her before the laughing mirror,
    Tying up her laces, looping up her hair,Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,
    More love should I have, and much less care.When her mother tends her before the lighted mirror,
    Loosening her laces, combing down her curls,Often she thinks, were this wild thing wedded,
    I should miss but one for many boys and girls.Heartless she is as the shadow in the meadows
    Flying to the hills on a blue and breezy noon.No, she is athirst and drinking up her wonder:
    Earth to her is young as the slip of the new moon.Deals she an unkindness, 'tis but her rapid measure,
    Even as in a dance; and her smile can heal no less:Like the swinging May-cloud that pelts the flowers with hailstones
    Off a sunny border, she was made to bruise and bless.Lovely are the curves of the white owl sweeping
    Wavy in the dusk lit by one large star.Lone on the fir-branch, his rattle-note unvaried,
    Brooding o'er the gloom, spins the brown eve-jar.Darker grows the valley, more and more forgetting:
    So were it with me if forgetting could be willed.Tell the grassy hollow that holds the bubbling well-spring,
    Tell it to forget the source that keeps it filled.Stepping down the hill with her fair companions,
    Arm in arm, all against the raying WestBoldly she sings, to the merry tune she marches,
    Brave in her shape, and sweeter unpossessed.Sweeter, for she is what my heart first awaking
    Whispered the world was; morning light is she.Love that so desires would fain keep her changeless;
    Fain would fling the net, and fain have her free.Happy happy time, when the white star hovers
    Low over dim fields fresh with bloomy dew,Near the face of dawn, that draws athwart the darkness,
    Threading it with colour, as yewberries the yew.Thicker crowd the shades while the grave East deepens
    Glowing, and with crimson a long cloud swells.Maiden still the morn is; and strange she is, and secret;
    Strange her eyes; her cheeks are cold as cold sea-shells.Sunrays, leaning on our southern hills and lighting
    Wild cloud-mountains that drag the hills along,Oft ends the day of your shifting brilliant laughter
    Chill as a dull face frowning on a song.Ay, but shows the South-West a ripple-feathered bosom
    Blown to silver while the clouds are shaken and ascendScaling the mid-heavens as they stream, there comes a sunset
    Rich, deep like love in beauty without end.When at dawn she sighs, and like an infant to the window
    Turns grave eyes craving light, released from dreams,Beautiful she looks, like a white water-lily
    Bursting out of bud in havens of the streams.When from bed she rises clothed from neck to ankle
    In her long nightgown sweet as boughs of May,Beautiful she looks, like a tall garden lily
    Pure from the night, and splendid for the day.Mother of the dews, dark eye-lashed twilight,
    Low-lidded twilight, o'er the valley's brim,Rounding on thy breast sings the dew-delighted skylark,
    Clear as though the dewdrops had their voice in him.Hidden where the rose-flush drinks the rayless planet,
    Fountain-full he pours the spraying fountain-showers.Let me hear her laughter, I would have her ever
    Cool as dew in twilight, the lark above the flowers.All the girls are out with their baskets for the primrose;
    Up lanes, woods through, they troop in joyful bands.My sweet leads: she knows not why, but now she totters,
    Eyes the bent anemones, and hangs her hands.Such a look will tell that the violets are peeping,
    Coming the rose: and unaware a crySprings in her bosom for odours and for colour,
    Covert and the nightingale; she knows not why.Kerchiefed head and chin she darts between her tulips,
    Streaming like a willow grey in arrowy rain:Some bend beaten cheek to gravel, and their angel
    She will be; she lifts them, and on she speeds again.Black the driving raincloud breasts the iron gateway:
    She is forth to cheer a neighbour lacking mirth.So when sky and grass met rolling dumb for thunder
    Saw I once a white dove, sole light of earth.Prim little scholars are the flowers of her garden,
    Trained to stand in rows, and asking if they please.I might love them well but for loving more the wild ones:
    O my wild ones! they tell me more than these.You, my wild one, you tell of honied field-rose,
    Violet, blushing eglantine in life; and even as they,They by the wayside are earnest of your goodness,
    You are of life's, on the banks that line the way.Peering at her chamber the white crowns the red rose,
    Jasmine winds the porch with stars two and three.Parted is the window; she sleeps; the starry jasmine
    Breathes a falling breath that carries thoughts of me.Sweeter unpossessed, have I said of her my sweetest?
    Not while she sleeps: while she sleeps the jasmine breathes,Luring her to love; she sleeps; the starry jasmine
    Bears me to her pillow under white rose-wreaths.Yellow with birdfoot-trefoil are the grass-glades;
    Yellow with cinquefoil of the dew-grey leaf;Yellow with stonecrop; the moss-mounds are yellow;
    Blue-necked the wheat sways, yellowing to the sheaf:Green-yellow bursts from the copse the laughing yaffle;
    Sharp as a sickle is the edge of shade and shine:Earth in her heart laughs looking at the heavens,
    Thinking of the harvest: I look and think of mine.This I may know: her dressing and undressing
    Such a change of light shows as when the skies in sportShift from cloud to moonlight; or edging over thunder
    Slips a ray of sun; or sweeping into portWhite sails furl; or on the ocean borders
    White sails lean along the waves leaping green.Visions of her shower before me, but from eyesight
    Guarded she would be like the sun were she seen.Front door and back of the mossed old farmhouse
    Open with the morn, and in a breezy linkFreshly sparkles garden to stripe-shadowed orchard,
    Green across a rill where on sand the minnows wink.Busy in the grass the early sun of summer
    Swarms, and the blackbird's mellow fluting notesCall my darling up with round and roguish challenge:
    Quaintest, richest carol of all the singing throats!Cool was the woodside; cool as her white dairy
    Keeping sweet the cream-pan; and there the boys from school,Cricketing below, rushed brown and red with sunshine;
    O the dark translucence of the deep-eyed cool!Spying from the farm, herself she fetched a pitcher
    Full of milk, and tilted for each in turn the beak.Then a little fellow, mouth up and on tiptoe,
    Said, ""I will kiss you"": she laughed and leaned her cheek.Doves of the fir-wood walling high our red roof
    Through the long noon coo, crooning through the coo.Loose droop the leaves, and down the sleepy roadway
    Sometimes pipes a chaffinch; loose droops the blue.Cows flap a slow tail knee-deep in the river,
    Breathless, given up to sun and gnat and fly.Nowhere is she seen; and if I see her nowhere,
    Lightning may come, straight rains and tiger sky.O the golden sheaf, the rustling treasure-armful!
    O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!O the treasure-tresses one another over
    Nodding! O the girdle slack about the waist!Slain are the poppies that shot their random scarlet
    Quick amid the wheatears: wound about the waist,Gathered, see these brides of Earth one blush of ripeness!
    O the nutbrown tresses nodding interlaced!Large and smoky red the sun's cold disk drops,
    Clipped by naked hills, on violet shaded snow:Eastward large and still lights up a bower of moonrise,
    Whence at her leisure steps the moon aglow.Nightlong on black print-branches our beech-tree
    Gazes in this whiteness: nightlong could I.Here may life on death or death on life be painted.
    Let me clasp her soul to know she cannot die!Gossips count her faults; they scour a narrow chamber
    Where there is no window, read not heaven or her.""When she was a tiny,"" one aged woman quavers,
    Plucks at my heart and leads me by the ear.Faults she had once as she learnt to run and tumbled:
    Faults of feature some see, beauty not complete.Yet, good gossips, beauty that makes holy
    Earth and air, may have faults from head to feet.Hither she comes; she comes to me; she lingers,
    Deepens her brown eyebrows, while in new surpriseHigh rise the lashes in wonder of a stranger;
    Yet am I the light and living of her eyes.Something friends have told her fills her heart to brimming,
    Nets her in her blushes, and wounds her, and tames.—Sure of her haven, O like a dove alighting,
    Arms up, she dropped: our souls were in our names.Soon will she lie like a white-frost sunrise.
    Yellow oats and brown wheat, barley pale as rye,Long since your sheaves have yielded to the thresher,
    Felt the girdle loosened, seen the tresses fly.Soon will she lie like a blood-red sunset.
    Swift with the to-morrow, green-winged Spring!Sing from the South-West, bring her back the truants,
    Nightingale and swallow, song and dipping wing.Soft new beech-leaves, up to beamy April
    Spreading bough on bough a primrose mountain, you,Lucid in the moon, raise lilies to the skyfields,
    Youngest green transfused in silver shining through:Fairer than the lily, than the wild white cherry:
    Fair as in image my seraph love appearsBorne to me by dreams when dawn is at my eyelids:
    Fair as in the flesh she swims to me on tears.Could I find a place to be alone with heaven,
    I would speak my heart out: heaven is my need.Every woodland tree is flushing like the dog-wood,
    Flashing like the whitebeam, swaying like the reed.Flushing like the dog-wood crimson in October;
    Streaming like the flag-reed South-West blown;Flashing as in gusts the sudden-lighted white beam:
    All seem to know what is for heaven alone.

Sigh out a story of her cruel deeds, With interrupted accents of despair: A monument that whosoever reads, May justly praise, and blame my loveless Fair. Say her disdain hath dried up my blood, And starved you, in succours still denying: Press to her eyes, importune me some good; Waken her sleeping pity with your crying. Knock at that hard heart, beg till you have moved her; And tell th’unkind, how dearly I have loved her.

She taught me the names of flowers: calendula, ranunculus, Iceland
poppy. And the medicinal uses of herbs: Fenugreek opens up a
stuffy head; goldenseal lubricates the cracked mucous membranes.
Over a circa 1820 American dropleaf table, she told me asparagus
was the broom of the kidneys. I hadn't understood at first and
thought she'd used a German word I pictured as brüm and not as the
little stalks standing on their heads, sweeping out the impurities. I
learned to make the perfect roux for soufflé and became her
efficient assistant in the kitchen—dicing and chopping, she once
told me, with unparalleled patience. Then one day she began to
accidentally break my Depression glassware, and I recalled how
she'd giggled when she told me that in two years of marriage she
had single-handedly decimated her husband's glass collection
dating from 1790 to 1810, including a rare wedding goblet. In the
doorway to the back porch she stated simply that my presence
made her feel strangled, it was nothing I was doing or could do. We
saw a therapist for six years, while my collection dwindled then
became memory. With unparalleled patience I jumped through
hoop after burning hoop, the therapist pointed out, but I heard that
as praise for my prowess and continued to balance Bauer plates on
my nose on command; hold growling tigers off with Windsor dining
room chairs; juggle career, job, hope, and nightly tempests with
unparalleled dexterity. I could reassemble anything: shattered pictures
of us crossing the street with canes in the future, my hand under her
elbow. My heart. But what I lacked, I can see now, was the ability
to dissemble. Finally, she brought home a Cuisinart food processor,
and I started hearing the minutes slicing away with ferocious velocity,
time doing its soft-shoe faster and faster like Fred Astaire on
amphetamines. Memories of flowers and herbs were sacrificed to
the angry god of its vortex. Your voice is like acid on my skin, she
said after twelve years, then grabbed her Cuisinart and left me
behind like so much history.

She left me at the silent timeWhen the moon had ceas'd to climbThe azure path of Heaven's steep,And like an albatross asleep,Balanc'd on her wings of light,Hover'd in the purple night,Ere she sought her ocean nestIn the chambers of the West.She left me, and I stay'd aloneThinking over every toneWhich, though silent to the ear,The enchanted heart could hear,Like notes which die when born, but stillHaunt the echoes of the hill;And feeling ever—oh, too much!—The soft vibration of her touch,As if her gentle hand, even now,Lightly trembled on my brow;And thus, although she absent were,Memory gave me all of herThat even Fancy dares to claim:Her presence had made weak and tameAll passions, and I lived aloneIn the time which is our own;The past and future were forgot,As they had been, and would be, not.But soon, the guardian angel gone,The daemon reassum'd his throneIn my faint heart. I dare not speakMy thoughts, but thus disturb'd and weakI sat and saw the vessels glideOver the ocean bright and wide,Like spirit-winged chariots sentO'er some serenest elementFor ministrations strange and far,As if to some Elysian starSailed for drink to medicineSuch sweet and bitter pain as mine.And the wind that wing'd their flightFrom the land came fresh and light,And the scent of winged flowers,And the coolness of the hoursOf dew, and sweet warmth left by day,Were scatter'd o'er the twinkling bay.And the fisher with his lampAnd spear about the low rocks dampCrept, and struck the fish which cameTo worship the delusive flame.Too happy they, whose pleasure soughtExtinguishes all sense and thoughtOf the regret that pleasure leaves,Destroying life alone, not peace!

In prologue let me plainly say
I shall not ever come to that discretion where
I do not rage to think I grow decrepit,
bursten-bellied, bald and toothless,
thick of hearing, tremulous of leg, dry
and rough-barked as a hemlock slab, the soft rot
setting in and all my wheezy dreams the tunnelling   
of beetles in a raspy bark. For now
I am fleshed at smaller sports, and grow in time
into the mineral thick fell of earth; Vermont
hairy with violets, roses, lilies and like
minions and darlings of the spring, meantime
working wonders, rousing astonishments. And
being a humble man, I at the same time acknowledge   
my miscreate: the nightshades, cabbages and fleaworts
of my plot, though always I try to turn my back and scorn   
upon the inkhorn term and speak as is most commonly   
received with smile and wink and approbative nod,   
not overfine nor at the same time reckless
of the phrase, nor ever ugly, turdy, tut-mouthed,
but always joyous at the goosey brain,
the woolpack of the solid cloud, a crowd, a heap,
a troop, a plume of trees, grass, gulls and rabbits,
in the end, no doubt, a vulgar prattle: but the planet
swells and bulges and protrudes beyond my eyes’ aversions,   
and tottery, fuddled, always I give up, I am not understood,   
or wrongly, out of some general assumption of my innocence.
2
This much I wish to say, my nonesuch, nosegay
native sweet, in someway plainer, this is my letter to you,   
and out of most severe purpose: the bee,
the honey stalk, the whole keep of the house
endanger me: the perspectives of the clapboard, the steep   
falls of the lawn, the razory apices of ridges,
and the abdominous curves of the meadow into the far   
trees. There are ponds below the house, and water runs.   
The road crosses the water, and the road
diminishes to the reach of the next farm, and the farm   
beyond that, and two miles bearing right or left   
somewhere runs Highway 25. I have found my way   
with difficulty, I am confused, halfway I have suffered   
a failure of vital powers, a swoon, have been
smirked at by the natives, and misdirected. Fitting,
for I always dream of the painless redemption, the return   
from fiasco and tumultuous journey to the transcendentally   
serene lawns of a transcendentally white house
with columns of oak trees and iron deer and the   
affectionate greeting of One who has these many years   
waited in full patience, without complaint,
for me to come in bleeding, dusty and deliquescent   
from the fields, the blade in my thigh, or blinded,   
the victim of fire or ravenous birds, the lovely blood   
on my cheek like tears, one-limbed, a bullet
in my heart, my hands, my head cut off and the dark   
pulses of my blood diminishing. Yet never a reproach   
for my criminal self-negligence, my careless japeries
and clumsy flounderings: instead, my brow is wiped, my   
wounds attended to, blood let, leeches applied: I heal,   
I grow strong, I can set forth again renewed, valiant,   
sturdy, full of high spirits, lively, gay, spruce
in looks, a reveler, a merry prankster, dimpled
in the cheek from smiling, perfect Pilgrim, fit   
for the chemistry of the Resurrection. Yet
I am of wild and changeful moods. I am perhaps worthy   
of being stoned, sometimes. I lie hid and lurk in wait   
for the giggling girleries and leap out and shout   
and scatter them like chickens from the boot to the safe   
and flying four winds. I am easy and fluent   
in the telling of lies, and let it be said that I roar
and sing scurrilous songs in base places, and shall no doubt   
for this little vain merriment find a sorrowful reckoning   
in the end. Still, my noises please me, and what   
this wretched poet overmuch desires, he easily believes.   
It is his conventional cowardice, it makes him   
immortally glad. But then he always grows morose   
(that is in his favor), he repents, lances his soul, thinks   
of the willows and the columned porch and the wind   
melliloquent about the chimneys, and you   
from where he sits now at the far end
of this small porch of a Federal farmhouse

I look down the pitches of the lawn:
fireflies make small explosions among the grass stems,   
and I think that to walk down that slant of lawn   
to the black waters of the brook at the dark join   
of the cleft would be like dying, and that if I die   
I will never pardon time. I think my words
will echo only in my own mind forever, to what purpose   
I do not know I see a firefly trapped inside the screen.   
I have no name for any of this; I know it clearly   
in the same way I know the dead cry of the starlings   
in the eaves, the smell of after rain, the warm
air holding in the hollows of the roads. For this   
there is no name. The holding mind is likewise   
without name. That is the final thought,
it is the disorder, the reason
for all this. The clouds
begin to reach up Blood Mountain,
and I am sitting on a farmhouse porch,
and there are trees, and it is late and I am dreaming   
that I dream I stare down into a fouled well and see   
the white legbones of a deer and the water’s surface   
matte with loose hair, the green stink welling
and bellying from the fertile sump up and flowing   
outwards in a fountaining current of vines and melons   
and leaves and the knotgrass lawns blossoming with gilliflowers,
shoulder-high, cloud-high, the sun finally smothering   
in grass, and then in the entire silence of this
growth the grasses thickening, darkening, becoming clouds,   
reaching up from the ridges. And all night
there is rain. I dream that when I awaken   
it is a shining milky day, four roosters   
are crowing in the yard and geese
dabble in the green soft muds of the ditches.
This is the literal surface, and for all
the extravagance of what has gone before   
I now repent, and make an image:   
All of Vermont each night blazes   
with fireflies, the comet is a faint
green phosphorescence to the North, the catalpas
blossom and each noon the sunlight hardens, and the sky

Always the script, the dramatic comma,
the pointed ellipsis, half turn, beat, the exit
itself as punctuation. Let’s say the back wall
of the house fell away: first cracks
down the plaster, then it crumbles
to reveal seventy-five rows of spectators.
That’s the explanation: they’ve been there
all along; I mulled blocking on a blind
impulse, but it turns out a correct one.
Maybe someone is making love to me
(in the 19th century sense): do I throw off
his hand, exit with pithy wit? Or simply
submit to it: the sappy moment
which will, I know, have to be resisted
in some later scene. Had I been there,
had it been me, I would have said—
and the audience would have been moved
to applaud. Astounding improvisation!
I’d have walked right up to the lawyer,
the bank manager, and I’d have said—
or, if it was me, it would never have gotten
that far; I’d have turned to her and said—
So I am contemplating in its shade
an apple tree. Haven’t I often done that?
So why not me? Late August, the leaves
like arrowheads, dark green, waxy,
punctuated by apples—constellations
of apples. There I see The Hunter, bow
pulled back, the apples of his quiver fixed
with perfect aim: William Tell, daughter
across the tree, of apples herself, poised
with a perfect fruit above her head:
wet tension of its surface, red skin
that kisses the sun. And this perfect tree.
This perfect tree in which every stamen
was touched by pollen, in which every
flower thickened to fruit: tree that knows
by its own example perfection. In each
cluster, five apples bunch as tight
as chambers of a human heart. Had I
been there, had it been me—and the slither
up the trunk brought my attention low,
the rippling body sliding along the trunk,
I who have been so good all these years
at resisting, and giving in, and resisting—
I’d have heard the melodious hiss, seen
the glinting tongue, its fork invading
the region of my heart, the archer
in that perfect canopy aiming right at me,
I who have given in to desire
when the stakes were much lower,
could I resist those movements, how fully
the serpent’s hiss gives itself over to simile:I am like, I am like, I am like. . . .
Seen it before, mister. I’d have sighed
in an aside, glanced up at the sky,
deadpanned the audience, and said—
Or had my lover brought the apple.
For years I have told them not to burn
money on me. But to bring only this,
to hold it out with a silent smile
as they enter the house, down center
on the stage of the palm. No better way
to say I love you. So why not me?
Early October, the outsize hunger
after running, and my lover brings it over.
I recognize on his breath the scent
of the serpent, and the apple, the one
forbidden thing. Deep voice, dark eyes,
silent smile and perfect apple;
only midday draped across his body,
tight, alert, alive to the moment of sin.
And reaching out to take it in my hand.
Who better than me? Let the tension
linger, let the audience pulse
with anticipation. We touch over
the forbidden fruit. The stage lights dim,
and I look at him, and I look at him,
and raise my eyebrows, and say—
But even so, wouldn’t I end up here again,
always here? Angels crossing swords
behind me, shame clothing me, conflating
all my losses—the loss of God, the loss
of apples, how they expand inside
to fill up hunger. Maybe there are
no words here, just the sky
blackening with anger. Maybe words
wouldn’t be useful here anyway.
Consider a scrim: the night sky blotted
of constellations; nothing but gray
swirls of wrath. And project against it
a man’s silhouette: head bent, empty-
handed, the memory of apples imprinted
on his wordless tongue, and around his
neck, loss—like a cowbell—announcing
his presence to the fallen world.

1.
In the windless late sunlight of August,
my father set fire to a globe of twine. At his back,
the harvested acres of bluegrass and timothy
rippled. I watched from a shallow hill
as the globe, chained to the flank of his pickup truck,
galloped and bucked down a yellow row, arced
at the fire trench, circled back,
arced again, the flames behind
sketching first a C, then closing to O—a word
or wreath, a flapping, slack-based heart,
gradually filling. To me at least. To the mare
beside me, my father dragged a gleaming fence,
some cinch-corral she might have known,
the way the walls moved rhythmically,
in and in. And to the crows, manic
on the thermals? A crescent of their planet,
gone to sudden sun. I watched one stutter
past the fence line, then settle
on a Hereford's tufted nape,
as if to peck some safer grain, as if
the red-cast back it rode
contained no transformations.
2.
A seepage, then, from the fire's edge: there
and there, the russet flood of rabbits.
Over the sounds of burning, their haunted calls
began, shrill and wavering, as if
their dormant voice strings
had tightened into threads of glass.
In an instant they were gone—the rabbits,
their voices—over the fire trench,
into the fallows. My father walked
near the burn line, waved up to me, and from
that wave, or the rippled film of heat,
I remembered our porch in an August wind,
how he stepped through the weathered doorway,
his hand outstretched with some
book-pressed flower, orchid or lily, withered
to a parchment brown. Here, he said, but
as he spoke it atomized before us—
pulp and stem, the pollened tongue,
dreadful in the dancing air.
3.
Scummed and boxcar thin,
six glass-walled houses stretched beside our fields.
Inside them, lilies, lilies—
a thousand shades of white, I think.
Eggshell, oyster, parchment, flax.
Far down the black-mulched beds, they seemed
ancestral to me, the fluted heads of
dowagers, their meaty, groping,
silent tongues. They seemed
to form perspective's chain:
cinder, bone, divinity. . .
4.
My father waved. The crows set down.
By evening, our fields took the texture
of freshened clay, a sleek
and water-bloated sheen, although no water
rested there—just heat and ash
united in a slick mirage. I crossed the fence line,
circled closer, the grasses all around me
collapsing into tufts of smoke. Then as I bent
I saw the shapes, rows and rows of tougher stems—
brittle, black, metallic wisps, like something grown
to echo grass. The soot was warm,
the sky held smoke in a jaundiced wing,
and as a breeze crossed slowly through,
stems glowed—then ebbed—
consecutively. And so revealed a kind of path,
and then a kind of journey.

To each his own hell. Mine was an uninhabited
landscape as far from nature as you can get
without actually leaving the planet, a man-made
moon waste on Sixth Avenue in Brooklyn,
fired in the sun’s kiln through unending
afternoons when I was nine or ten.
I can never get the whole scene put together
in my head, thanks to whatever guardian
spirit flags down potentially dangerous
intruders on the verge of memory,
but parts of me hold parts of it: my ears
play out the hissing wires’ repeated rise
and fall, dry waves breaking above pavement;
my nostrils chafe where fumes of gasoline
weep from soft tarred patches in the asphalt;
through a chainlink grid, my eyes take in
some lot’s trapped beach, its black sand an amalgam
of gravel, soot, and broken glass; or they blink
in sequence with the traffic light’s perpetual
solitaire at a carless intersection,
flicking over greens, ambers, reds;
my hands remember enough not to touch
the shut steel trap doors of delivery chutes
where air trembles over surfaces
as at their beginnings in a furnace.
What fills my mind to bursting is emptiness,
the spirit of inverted Genesis
transforming light and water’s urge towards fullness
into a miracle of unearthly loss.2.
Sentries, a pair of gasoline pumps napped.
Their rubber arms dangled groundwards and looped
back up, hanging slack from the brass lapel
their trigger-fingers hooked at shoulder height.
They were no angels, but kept the gate of hell
whenever I made visits to the angels.
Behind them, next to a roll-up garage door
always rolled up, with an invisible car
always risen above the stone lintel
on the hydraulic lift, a soft drink cooler
sat coffin-like against the stucco wall.
And always songs from a hidden radio
promised cool mountain rivers to the hot
flat city: somebody else must have listened,
but I never saw a soul in all my visits.
The angels’ wings fluttered the moment I raised
the lid, a potent shimmer, as if the sun
itself shone from the chest, not its reflections
playing off the steel bars and icy waters.
The angels sat in rows between the bars,
their orders chevroned by the shapes and colours
of their glass capes: the bluish, scalloped whorl
of cherubim, the powers’ straight sheer crystal,
the emerald flare of flaming seraphim—
all emissaries from the sky-washed shore
of heaven. To put a coin in the dispenser,
slide one of them along its plated channel
and lift it free through the chest’s narrow gate—
to kiss the cold stars of its distillation—
was not important; it was only important
to see the angels swimming in the glitter
and dip my fingers in their flickering water
at the centre of that man-made desert,
knowing that they were man-made, and might shatter.

IV. The Fireflies I have climbed blind the way down through the trees (How faint the phosphorescence of the stones) On nights when not a light showed on the bay And nothing marked the line of sky and sea—Only the beating of the heart definedA space of being in the faceless dark,The foot that found and won the path from blindness, The hand, outstretched, that touched on branch and bark. The soundless revolution of the stars Brings back the fireflies and each constellation, And we are here half-shielded from that height Whose star-points feed the white lactation, far Incandescence where the single starIs lost to sight. This is a waiting time.Those thirty, lived-out years were slow to rhyme With consonances unforeseen, and, gone, Were brief beneath the seasons and the sun. We wait now on the absence of our dead, Sharing the middle world of moving lights Where fireflies taking torches to the rose Hover at those clustered, half-lit porches, Eyelid on closed eyelid in their glow Flushed into flesh, then darkening as they go. The adagio of lights is gatheringAcross the sway and counter-lines as bay And sky, contrary in motion, swerve Against each other's patternings, while these Tiny, travelling fires gainsay them both, Trusting to neither empty space nor seas The burden of their weightless circlings. We, Knowing no more of death than other men Who make the last submission and return, Savour the good wine of a summer's night Fronting the islands and the harbour bar, Uncounted in the sum of our unknowingsHow sweet the fireflies’ span to those who live it, Equal, in their arrivals and their goings, With the order and the beauty of star on star.

Out of the bosom of the Air,       Out of the cloud-folds of her garments shaken, Over the woodlands brown and bare,       Over the harvest-fields forsaken,             Silent, and soft, and slow             Descends the snow. Even as our cloudy fancies take       Suddenly shape in some divine expression, Even as the troubled heart doth make       In the white countenance confession,             The troubled sky reveals             The grief it feels. This is the poem of the air,       Slowly in silent syllables recorded; This is the secret of despair,       Long in its cloudy bosom hoarded,             Now whispered and revealed             To wood and field.

One will live to see the Caterpillar rut everything
they walk on—seacliff buckwheat cleared, relentless
ice plant to replace it, the wild fields bisected
by the scenic highway, canyons covered with cul-de-sacs,
gas stations, comfortable homes, the whole habitat
along this coastal stretch endangered, everything,
everyone, everywhere in it danger as well—
but now they're logging the one stilling hawk
Smith sights, the conspiring grasses' shh shhhh ssh,
the coreopsis Mattoni's boot barely spares,
and, netted, a solitary blue butterfly. Smith
ahead of him chasing the stream, Mattoni wonders
if he plans to swim again. Just like that
the spell breaks. It's years later, Mattoni lecturing
on his struggling butterfly. How fragile.
  
           • 
If his daughter spooled out the fabric
she's chosen for her wedding gown,
raw taffeta, burled, a bright hued tan,
perhaps Mattoni would remember
how those dunes looked from a distance,
the fabric, balanced between her arms,
making valleys in the valley, the fan
above her mimicking the breeze.
He and his friend loved everything
softly undulating under the coyest wind,
and the rough truth as they walked
through the land's scratch and scrabble
and no one was there, then, besides Mattoni
and his friend, walking along Dolan's Creek,
in that part of California they hated
to share. The ocean, a mile or so off,
anything but passive so that even there,
in the canyon, they sometimes heard it smack
and pull well-braced rocks. The breeze,
basic: salty, bitter, sour, sweet. Smith trying
to identify the scent, tearing leaves
of manzanita, yelling: ""This is it. Here! This is it!""
his hand to his nose, his eyes, having finally seen
the source of his pleasure, alive.
               •
In the lab, after the accident, he remembered it,
the butterfly. How good a swimmer Smith had been,
how rough the currents there at Half Moon Bay, his friend
alone with reel and rod—Mattoni back at school
early that year, his summer finished too soon—
then all of them together in the sneaker wave,
and before that the ridge, congregations of pinking
blossoms, and one of them bowing, scaring up the living,
the frail and flighty beast too beautiful
to never be pinned, those nights Mattoni worked
without his friend, he remembered too.
He called the butterfly Smith's Blue.

On the fleet streams, the Sun, that late arose,    In amber radiance plays; the tall young grass    No foot hath bruised; clear morning, as I pass,    Breathes the pure gale, that on the blossom blows; And, as with gold yon green hill’s summit glows,    The lake inlays the vale with molten glass:    Now is the year’s soft youth, yet one, alas!    Cheers not as it was wont; impending woes Weigh on my heart; the joys, that once were mine,    Spring leads not back; and those that yet remain    Fade while she blooms. Each hour more lovely shine Her crystal beams, and feed her floral train,    But oh with pale, and warring fires, decline    Those eyes, whose light my filial hopes sustain.

                ","
A car is idling on the cliff. Its top is down. Its headlights throw A faint, bright ghost-shadow glow On the pale air. On the shore, so far Below that the waves' push and drag Is dwindled to a hush—a kind Of oceanic idle—the sea Among the boulders plays a blind- Fold game of hide and seek, Or capture the flag. The flag Swells and sways. The car Is empty. A Friday, the first week Of June. Nineteen fifty-three. A car's idling on the cliff, But surely it won't be long before Somebody stops to investigate And things begin to happen fast: Men, troops of men will come, Arrive with blazing lights, a blast Of sirens, followed by still more Men. Though not a soul's in sight, The peace of the end of the late Afternoon—the sun down, but enough light Even so to bathe the heavens from Horizon to shore in a deep And delicate blue—will not keep. Confronted with such an overload Of questions (most beginning, Why would she... So gifted, bright, and only twenty-three), Attention will come to fix upon This odd last thing she did: leaving The car running, the headlights on. She stopped—it will transpire—to fill The tank a mere two miles down the road. (Just sixteen, the kid at the station will Quote her as saying, ""What a pity You have to work today! It's not right... What weather! Goodness, what a night It'll be!"" He'll add: ""She sure was pretty."") Was there a change of plan? Why the stop for gas? Possibly She'd not yet made up her mind? Or Had made it up but not yet settled On a place? Or could it be she knew Where she was headed, what she would do— And wanted to make sure the car ran For hours afterward? Might the car not be, Then, a sort of beacon, a lighthouse- In-reverse, meant to direct one not Away from but toward the shore And its broken boulders, there to spot The bobbing white flag of a blouse? Her brief note, which will appear In the local Leader, contains a phrase (""She chanted snatches of old lands"") That will muddle the town for three days, Until a Professor E. H. Wade Pins it to Ophelia—and reprimands The police, who, this but goes to show, Have not the barest knowledge of Shakespeare, Else would never have misread ""lauds"" As ""lands."" A Detective Gregg Messing Will answer, tersely, ""Afraid It's not our bailiwick. Missing Persons, yes; missing poems, no."" (What's truly tragic's never allowed To stand alone for long, of course. At each moment there's a crowd Of clowns pressing in: the booming ass At every wake who, angling a loud Necktie in the chip dip, Airs his problems with intestinal gas, Or the blow-dried bonehead out to sell Siding to the grieving mother . . . . Well, Wade sent the Leader another briefword: ""Decades of service to the Bard now force Me to amend the girl's little slip. 'Chaunted' not 'chanted' is the preferred . . ."") Yet none of her unshakeable entourage —Pedants, pundits, cops without a clue, And a yearning young grease-monkey—are Alerted yet. Still the empty car Idles, idles on the cliff, and night Isn't falling so much as day Is floating out to sea . . . . Soon, whether She's found or not, her lights will draw Moths and tiny dark-winged things that might Be dirt-clumps, ashes. Come what may, The night will be lovely, as she foresaw, The first stars easing through the blue, Engine and ocean breathing together.

walk single file across the black edge,

All fall I played at being a slave.

They held the scruffs of their necks,
whacked their soft brown crowns
with cracked baseball bats.
Each one bled through the nose.
We fed their guts to the alligator
by the shed in the deep, deep hole.13
I watched them kissing, kissing in sorrow,
in the sitting rooms in the funeral parlor.
They were drinking cafe au lait
and eating ham sandwiches.
Yes, there were so many flowers.
I didn’t want to be kissed in sorrow.
I didn’t want to be patted or pitied.14
The squeak and thump and mist of flit
as someone pumped sprays of insecticide.

like a tingling sensation in my fingers,
like a thousand evaporating lessons,
it fell on the oil lamp’s wick.
The flame danced. It wobbled, dipped and brightened.

                ","
Pollination against the seed to grow canopy
and mark place in shades of green—dry here to reflect
in glassine quartz chips in the off-red dirt where trees tree
as the forest is difference there green-inflected light you nurtured far
where volcanic would give name in poem or misty rain for each better-
suited frond of palm, its trunk, those particular roots. Here, so dry.
Not to have visited outside the lines you published,
strands of rain where trade winds dry as here easterlies
sap the energy of watering. It’s where we read, as you knew,
where the single tree in a back garden opens out to all
trees momentarily safe, or at least alive, before the chop.
I knew a man who tried to make a suburban backyard into a palm house.Arecaceae would seem like part of the joke as we measure
tank rungs and how many waterings left, aside from our drinking.
But you see them where farmhouses were built and lost or condemned
for varying reasons—twin date palms (“fate palms”) thick and robust
and the scrabble of rubble and chimney between. But no habitat of like, just addendum.
Living in a shack there was a single great chestnut, not a walnut, out of place.
A chestnut introduced like a vision of walks, the tessellations
of light collected into prayer, which is where it began for you. And for others.
The mirror of any leaf, the flipside, the reverse, is the growing and falling
enigma—even here among the non-deciduous, dry leaves fall, stroke light.
Whole branches cut off from the supply when sap is difficult to supplement, create.
That vegetation cleared for plantation leaps shadows out of wasted soil, to scaffold.Gardening. I have known so many gardeners who sought
to build hope out of the clearing, to remake an image of plenty,
of sharing fresh air and taking stale breath. Each quietly “oracular,” if in denial,
each afraid of drought though remembering greened light in their plans,
their reticulation, their watching the weather. To make a calm to spread—there if we bother to look, to listen to the birds moving in and out, some staying.
You knew back gardens, and you knew the streets made bare, as they
are here—say, of Melbourne, green-gilled city, whose old planted trees become expendable?
Or where I am, huge chunks of bush grubbed out daily with excuses made
or not bothered with—hard to keep track of outside the shade of verandas, offices.
Or among the palms on another island, Réunion, the warning of offensive odor
though a beauty that might make an activist or remaker of demi-lost verse forms.
What is there in common, across the list of names, of species—growing
conditions, from a part of the world far from where they’re coaxed into a differing
light? What is there in common if we’re not in the place of writing,
and yet we are grown into, welded rhizome by rhizome? You cannot take
the first bird I see today—a yellow-rumped thornbill tuning in, foraging
for the rest of the small flock—any more than I would choose to. It tends the image.
Each cell an art to tempt and let be to rebuild the soil. But no profiling,
and no conflict. The straggly tenuous but tough contradictions of York gums’
outer reaches supple but brittle closer to a perception of where a heart might rest,
termites holding the strings of a pacemaker, split and opening out to tempt owlet nightjars—
I heard one calling from a broken limb at 10:49 the other night and you were still breathing,
sleeping your breath to the canopy of world? That near and far line of prayer.
Once, on a very small island, a coral island big enough for a dozen palms
and a colony of land crabs and two humans, the heart of a young palm
was torn out and handed over to the one unfamiliar with its form or taste.
He ate, and the palm was gone. Coconuts were spouting, finding and making
on the atoll, at the outer. Lugging vats of water up and down the valley wall,
I think this, and your line, a late line: “nothing is missing”—a conclusion?
I wrote of that palmheart for a heart surgeon years ago because all elegies
are entwined, even those of different endocrines. The circulatory system of memorials.
If welcomed under the green light of plantings, the off-spectrum aspiration
against grief, I would have told you of the jam tree—acacia acuminata—
because we are surrounded by them against the odds, and they come back,
thriving on disturbed ground, with trouble around them. Short-lived treeshrubs,
their rough bark exchanges codes of camouflage with stick insects, as I look
now and can’t see beyond the idea of an insect being there, legs forward like antennae.
Rot here is powder rather than mulch, mostly. Saplings rise to spend time dying.
But some pull through and some will become part of the width of those great jarrahs
felled by ancestors, their essences pushing against climate to make good.
My “you” can’t be yours, but the moon and sun do their own syzygy for us all.
Language is vegetation. I knew a couple who screened their cedar kit home
from a country pub with a line then another line and another line of native trees.
I have a family who planted tens of thousands of trees to reclaim saltland settlement
hauled out of its deep sleeping, its subroots. I knew a person who filled empty
paddocks with trees deleted for a new suburb, next to the new suburb where
bushland had hung on against the trend, gone late. To have known morning in those places!
I know you’ll have known this—how thick vegetation, the uprights and bends
of trees on a still morning, can enhance our ability to pick out the between-notes
of birdwork. You wrote of clarity, and translated ornate forms, to be filled with a moment’s
singularity. Respiration. Our greatest breath might be so low or a rasp like a storm
coming in to rejuvenate, to depart with cataclysm. And so we pass with varying
degrees of light, the need for oxygen in the dismantling of carbohydrates.
Night is eating of oxygen. But more, much more out in bare day. So in our sleep
we join the trees, wrapped in leaves and fronds, held out of consciousness by tendrils.
So we thank god for photosynthesis more than we thank god for the sun as itself?
Here, we have valley, we have curved rim of valley closing out, here we have a kite, too—
a black-shouldered kite that hovers above the infrequent powerlines and self-supply,
and here we have year building on year that is an aside to a past that builds in all directions.
The inner green of room cracked in the thermal economics of presence
that underwrites reflection in crops and their residues, a shattering of light
in glassy stubble, the march against concrete and lead, against ordnance
and conquest, just roots holding soil so dry it is tempted to lift as a plume
across the district, hungering after the great dust devil that took off a roof
and opened a house down near Picnic Hill Road not long after you passed.
Interior of wood of fallen branch of loosened fibers and machines striking out
from gravel shoulders to lay great flooded gums on creek beds a trickle of old seasons
green with algae, green with signatures of flow, the bridges where great roots held sway.
What remakes such wasted soil? We try local species and intertwine with olive trees.
And in our suppressed thoughts, palmistry is a lush future of shade and flycatchers
maintaining the relationship between mosquitoes and moisture. No toxins; no anti-growth.
Our night-lights out here stick out sharp—sore thumb exposure, a failure of perspective
of what is lured to the hot light. Mouth dry. We go away too and bring places
back in descriptions but we won’t let them set root—they grow inside and reach
no light, this bright light that weakens accustoming eyes over time, straining
to pick out moss from lichen, which shields the granite boulders it breaks down.
Gradient cuts underfoot the echidna following termite galleries, interstices
of plumbed surface-sounds. We go back to the records, the old books, which are young
and would replace those earlier cuckoo sounds, the kickings-out in nests, the breaking
through of secret chambers—all here, too, like birth, but with an unanswered history,
or partially echoed and not fully addressed. This stuff we do with our souls to adjust
the fragments of bush to whose maps? To miss the kangaroo trail though it’s before our eyes,
or the path of an elusive rain, or a lake whose existence you might request, hint at, question?
Diverse as the air after war is gone but we still can’t breathe so something slips
or grafts. The stain. We rely on such conservancy, on gestures of repair and renewal
that regenerate, to sustain with hands-off learning to let be, to live alongside,
harvest no more than needs be. Such need manifests. Such sleep of passing
is the caveat, is the covenant is the testament of work that rains without a cloud in the sky.
Memorandum of walk of planting of tending: crowbar to break soil or soft cell, either way.
Mostly, people search for pathways to exemptions
so they can cut down protected trees. Mostly, people
search for ways to get around those thin laws so they
can bring down an old system of life. But here, too, we
want to keep the trees going against the trend of felling,
to give breath to those who stifle the art of growth.
Pollination with the grain to grow canopy
and mark place in shades of green—dry here to reflect
from fool’s gold but grow gnarled out of off-red dirt we coax with seedlings
if rain sets green-inflected light you nurtured far from here, far where necessities
work outside the poem for each better-suited frond of palm frond, a eucalypt trunk,
any particular roots. Dry wet dry. Making growth to suit a soil’s recovery.

On thy stupendous summit, rock sublime! That o’er the channel reared, half way at sea The mariner at early morning hails, I would recline; while Fancy should go forth, And represent the strange and awful hour Of vast concussion; when the Omnipotent Stretched forth his arm, and rent the solid hills, Bidding the impetuous main flood rush between The rifted shores, and from the continent Eternally divided this green isle. Imperial lord of the high southern coast! From thy projecting head-land I would mark Far in the east the shades of night disperse, Melting and thinned, as from the dark blue wave Emerging, brilliant rays of arrowy light Dart from the horizon; when the glorious sun Just lifts above it his resplendent orb. Advances now, with feathery silver touched, The rippling tide of flood; glisten the sands, While, inmates of the chalky clefts that scar Thy sides precipitous, with shrill harsh cry, Their white wings glancing in the level beam, The terns, and gulls, and tarrocks, seek their food, And thy rough hollows echo to the voice Of the gray choughs, and ever restless daws, With clamor, not unlike the chiding hounds, While the lone shepherd, and his baying dog, Drive to thy turfy crest his bleating flock. The high meridian of the day is past, And Ocean now, reflecting the calm Heaven, Is of cerulean hue; and murmurs low The tide of ebb, upon the level sands.

                ","
He that had come that morning,   
One after the other,
Over seven hills,
Each of a new color,
Came now by the last tree,   
By the red-colored valley,   
To a gray river
Wide as the sea.
There at the shingle
A listing wherry
Awash with dark water;   
What should it carry?
There on the shelving,   
Three dark gentlemen.   
Might they direct him?   
Three gentlemen.
“Cable, friend John, John Cable,”   
When they saw him they said,   
“Come and be company
As far as the far side.”
“Come follow the feet,” they said,   
“Of your family,
Of your old father
That came already this way.”
But Cable said, “First I must go   
Once to my sister again;
What will she do come spring   
And no man on her garden?
She will say ‘Weeds are alive   
From here to the Stream of Friday;   
I grieve for my brother’s plowing,’
Then break and cry.”
“Lose no sleep,” they said, “for that fallow:   
She will say before summer,
‘I can get me a daylong man,
Do better than a brother.’ ”
Cable said, “I think of my wife:   
Dearly she needs consoling;   
I must go back for a little
For fear she die of grieving.”
“Cable,” they said, “John Cable,   
Ask no such wild favor;
Still, if you fear she die soon,   
The boat might wait for her.”
But Cable said, “I remember:   
Out of charity let me
Go shore up my poorly mother,   
Cries all afternoon.”
They said, “She is old and far,   
Far and rheumy with years,   
And, if you like, we shall take   
No note of her tears.”
But Cable said, “I am neither   
Your hired man nor maid,   
Your dog nor shadow
Nor your ape to be led.”
He said, “I must go back:
Once I heard someone say
That the hollow Stream of Friday   
Is a rank place to lie;
And this word, now I remember,   
Makes me sorry: have you   
Thought of my own body   
I was always good to?
The frame that was my devotion   
And my blessing was,
The straight bole whose limbs   
Were long as stories—
Now, poor thing, left in the dirt   
By the Stream of Friday
Might not remember me
Half tenderly.”
They let him nurse no worry;
They said, “We give you our word:   
Poor thing is made of patience;   
Will not say a word.”
“Cable, friend John, John Cable,”   
After this they said,
“Come with no company
To the far side.
To a populous place,
A dense city
That shall not be changed   
Before much sorrow dry.”
Over shaking water
Toward the feet of his father,   
Leaving the hills’ color
And his poorly mother
And his wife at grieving   
And his sister’s fallow   
And his body lying   
In the rank hollow,
Now Cable is carried   
On the dark river;   
Nor even a shadow   
Followed him over.
On the wide river   
Gray as the sea
Flags of white water   
Are his company.

Body is something you need in order to stay

be satisfactory. It will not be beautiful
enough, it will not be fast enough, it will
not keep on for days at a time, but will
pull you down into a sleepy swamp and
demand apples and coffee and chocolate cake.
Body is a thing you have to carry
from one day into the next. Always the
same eyebrows over the same eyes in the same
skin when you look in the mirror, and the
same creaky knee when you get up from the
floor and the same wrist under the watchband.
The changes you can make are small and
costly—better to leave it as it is.
Body is a thing that you have to leave
eventually. You know that because you have
seen others do it, others who were once like you,
living inside their pile of bones and
flesh, smiling at you, loving you,
leaning in the doorway, talking to you
for hours and then one day they

There was a fire in the night.
Across the street I slept among the others
as the ashes snowed upon small pines.
I slept owning nothing, a child ignorant
of fortune’s blistering story, the playful
flash in the dark, the unseen smolder
that would leave us revealed, unchanged.
I said my prayers for luck
but the man trying to live in two houses
answers me now, losing
neither the old one whose windows burst
with weariness, nor the one half-built
whose roofless, green timbers
he would leave unfinished like a vision.
I had climbed there all summer to smoke.
Awake, I found him sitting at his stool
halfway between the houses
where I would go each morning. The story
of the sea would be upon his tongue,
his hands weaving the wire to a trap,
making the careful seams to catch
a scuttling crab. Beyond him, his wife
already had begun to stretch her wash,
indifferent in that early light, and a dog
lapped from the ruts of the fire truck.
I believed little had been changed by fire,
only his toolshed limp as a black sail
left in a heap, and a new hole
in the landscape. This was an old place
where no one came, luckless, desperate,
eternal as guilt. In silence
I greeted that old one. But now I remember
seeing also, as if for the first time,
the shocking gray face of the sea.

worked, and seemed to sink
while they burned in the sullen sun.

The pathIs slushed with cattle-tracks and fallen timber,The stumps are twisted by the tempests’ wrath.But that I knew these places are my own,I’d ask how came such wretchedness to cumberThe earth, and I to people it alone.It rains across the country I remember.

                ","
This morning a cat—bright orange—pawing at the one patch of new grass in the sand-and tanbark-colored leaves.
And last night the sapphire of the raccoon's eyes in the beam of the flashlight.
He was climbing a tree beside the house, trying to get onto the porch, I think, for a wad of oatmeal
Simmered in cider from the bottom of the pan we'd left out for the birds.
And earlier a burnished, somewhat dazed woodchuck, his coat gleaming with spring,
Loping toward his burrow in the roots of a tree among the drying winter's litter
Of old leaves on the floor of the woods, when I went out to get the New York Times.
And male cardinals whistling back and forth—sireeep, sreeep, sreeep—
Sets of three sweet full notes, weaving into and out of each other like the triplet rhymes in medieval poetry,
And the higher, purer notes of the tufted titmice among them,
High in the trees where they were catching what they could of the early sun.
And a doe and two yearlings, picking their way along the worrying path they'd made through the gully, their coats the color of the forest floor,
Stopped just at the roots of the great chestnut where the woodchuck's burrow was,
Froze, and the doe looked back over her shoulder at me for a long moment, and leapt forward,
Her young following, and bounded with that almost mincing precision in the landing of each hoof
Up the gully, over it, and out of sight. So that I remembered
Dreaming last night that a deer walked into the house while I was writing at the kitchen table,
Came in the glass door from the garden, looked at me with a stilled defiant terror, like a thing with no choices,
And, neck bobbing in that fragile-seeming, almost mechanical mix of arrest and liquid motion, came to the table
And snatched a slice of apple, and stood, and then quietened, and to my surprise did not leave again.
And those little captains, the chickadees, swift to the feeder and swift away.
And the squirrels with their smoke-plume tails trailing digging in the leaves to bury or find buried—
I'm told they don't remember where they put things, that it's an activity of incessant discovery—
Nuts, tree-fall proteins, whatever they forage from around the house of our leavings,
And the flameheaded woodpecker at the suet with his black-and-white ladderback elegant fierceness—
They take sunflower seeds and stash them in the rough ridges of the tree's bark
Where the beaks of the smoke-and-steel blue nuthatches can't quite get at them—
Though the nuthatches sometimes seem to get them as they con the trees methodically for spiders' eggs or some other overwintering insect's intricately packaged lump of futurity
Got from its body before the cold came on.
And the little bat in the kitchen lightwell—
When I climbed on a chair to remove the sheet of wimpled plastic and let it loose,
It flew straight into my face and I toppled to the floor, chair under me,
And it flared down the hall and did what seemed a frantic reconnoiter of the windowed, high-walled living room.
And lit on a brass firelog where it looked like a brown and ash
grey teenaged suede glove with Mephistophelean dreams,
And then, spurt of black sperm, up, out the window, and into the twilight woods.
All this life going on about my life, or living a life about all this life going on,
Being a creature, whatever my drama of the moment, at the edge of the raccoon's world—
He froze in my flashlight beam and looked down, no affect, just looked,
The ringtail curled and flared to make him look bigger and not to be messed with—
I was thinking he couldn't know how charming his comic-book robber's mask was to me,
That his experience of his being and mine of his and his of mine were things entirely apart,
Though there were between us, probably, energies of shrewd and respectful tact, based on curiosity and fear—
I knew about his talons whatever he knew about me—
And as for my experience of myself, it comes and goes, I'm not sure it's any one thing, as my experience of these creatures is not,
And I know I am often too far from it or too near, glad to be rid of it which is why it was such a happiness,
The bright orange of the cat, and the first pool of green grass-leaves in early April, and the birdsong—that orange and that green not colors you'd set next to one another in the human scheme.
And the crows' calls, even before you open your eyes, at sunup.

The system is moving from the paved yard Y to the corner C,

    to the forest F, from the forest F to the horizon H.
The horizon H is the point where vision ends
    and memory begins.
Nevertheless the system is moving
    at a constant velocity v,
    along a constant path,
    through a constant destiny,
renewing its impulse and its meaning

A relatively independent system:
in landscapes from horizon to horizon
always just one old woman with a barrow.

Nothing inside your head lasting long enough for you to hold onto,  you watch your own thoughts leap across your own synapses and disappear— small boats in a wind,         fliers in all that blue,                 the swish of an arm backed with feathers,  a dress talking in a corner,                 and then poof,         your mind clean as a dog’s,  your body big as the world,         important with accident—                blood or a limp, fur and paws.  You swell into survival,         you take up the whole day,  you’re all there is,         everything else is  not you, is every passing glint, is         shadows brought to you by wind,                 passing into a bird’s cheep, replaced by a                                rabbit skittering across a yard,  a void you yourself fall into.  You could make this beautiful,         but you don’t need to,  living is this fleshy side of the bone,         going on is this medicinal smell of the sun—                no dog ever tires of seeing his life  keep showing up at the back door  even as a rotting bone with a bad smell;  feet tottering, he dreams of it,  wakes and licks no matter what.

Goethe in Weimar sleeps, and Greece,Long since, saw Byron's struggle cease.But one such death remain'd to come;The last poetic voice is dumb—We stand to-day by Wordsworth's tomb.When Byron's eyes were shut in death,We bow'd our head and held our breath.He taught us little; but our soulHad felt him like the thunder's roll.With shivering heart the strife we sawOf passion with eternal law;And yet with reverential aweWe watch'd the fount of fiery lifeWhich served for that Titanic strife.
    When Goethe's death was told, we said:Sunk, then, is Europe's sagest head.Physician of the iron age,Goethe has done his pilgrimage.He took the suffering human race,He read each wound, each weakness clear;And struck his finger on the place,And said: Thou ailest here, and here! He look'd on Europe's dying hourOf fitful dream and feverish power;His eye plunged down the weltering strife,The turmoil of expiring life—He said: The end is everywhere,Art still has truth, take refuge there!And he was happy, if to knowCauses of things, and far belowHis feet to see the lurid flowOf terror, and insane distress,And headlong fate, be happiness.And Wordsworth!—Ah, pale ghosts, rejoice!For never has such soothing voiceBeen to your shadowy world convey'd,Since erst, at morn, some wandering shadeHeard the clear song of Orpheus comeThrough Hades, and the mournful gloom.Wordsworth has gone from us—and ye,Ah, may ye feel his voice as we!He too upon a wintry climeHad fallen—on this iron timeOf doubts, disputes, distractions, fears.He found us when the age had boundOur souls in its benumbing round;He spoke, and loosed our heart in tears.He laid us as we lay at birthOn the cool flowery lap of earth,Smiles broke from us and we had ease;The hills were round us, and the breezeWent o'er the sun-lit fields again;Our foreheads felt the wind and rain.Our youth return'd; for there was shedOn spirits that had long been dead,Spirits dried up and closely furl'd,The freshness of the early world.Ah! since dark days still bring to lightMan's prudence and man's fiery might,Time may restore us in his courseGoethe's sage mind and Byron's force;But where will Europe's latter hourAgain find Wordsworth's healing power?Others will teach us how to dare,And against fear our breast to steel;Others will strengthen us to bear—But who, ah! who, will make us feel?The cloud of mortal destiny,Others will front it fearlessly—But who, like him, will put it by?Keep fresh the grass upon his grave,O Rotha, with thy living wave!Sing him thy best! for few or noneHears thy voice right, now he is gone.

                ","
The year I was born the atomic bomb went off. Here I'd just begun, and someone found the switch to turn off the world. In the furnace-light, in the central solar fire of that heat lamp, the future got very finite, and it was possible to imagine time-travelers failing to arrive, because there was no future. Inside the great dark clock in the hall, heavy brass cylinders descended. Tick-tock, the chimes changed their tune one phrase at a time. The bomb became a film star, its glamorous globe of smoke searing the faces of men in beach chairs. Someone threw up every day at school. No time to worry about collective death, when life itself was permeated by ordeals. And so we grew up, beneath an umbrella of acceptance. In bio we learned there were particles cruising through us like whales through archipelagoes, and in civics that if Hitler had gotten the bomb he'd have used it on the inferior races, and all this time love was etching its scars on our skins like maps. The heavens remained pure, except for little white slits on the perfect blue skin that planes cut in the icy upper air, like needles sewing. From one, a tiny seed might fall that would make a sun on earth. And so the century passed, with me still in it, books waiting on the shelves to become cinders, what we felt locked up inside, waiting to be read, down the long corridor of time. I was born the year the bomb exploded. Twice whole cities were charred like cities in the Bible, but we didn't look back. We went on thinking we could go on, our shapes the same, darkened now against a background lit by fire. Forgive me for doubting you're there, Citizens, on your holodecks with earth wallpaper—a shadow-toned ancestor with poorly pressed pants, protected like a child from knowing the future.

I knew the holiday was hot. I saw
The August sun teeming in the bodies
Logged along the beach and felt the yearning

To each. For lunch I bit the olive meat:
A yellow jacket stung me on the tongue.
I knelt to spoon and suck the healing sea ...
A little girl was digging up canals
With her toes, her arm hanging in a cast
As white as the belly of a dead fish
Whose dead eye looked at her with me, as she
Opened her grotesque system to the sea ...
I walked away; now quietly I heard
A child moaning from a low mound of sand,
Abandoned by his friend. The child was tricked,
Trapped upon his knees in a shallow pit.
(The older ones will say you can get out.)
I dug him up. His legs would not unbend.
I lifted him and held him in my arms
As he wept. Oh I was gnarled as a witch
Or warlock by his naked weight, was slowed
In the sand to a thief’s gait. When his strength
Flowed, he ran, and I rested by the sea ...
A girl was there. I saw her drop her hair,
Let it fall from the doffed cap to her breasts
Tanned and swollen over wine red woolen.
A boy, his body blackened by the sun,
Rose out of the sand stripping down his limbs
With graceful hands. He took his gear and walked
Toward the girl in the brown hair and wine
And then past me; he brushed her with the soft,
Brilliant monster he lugged into the sea ...
By this tide I raised a small cairn of stone
Light and smooth and clean, and cast the shadow
Of a stick in a perfect line along
The sand. My own shadow followed then, until
I felt the cold swirling at the groin.

Hemming the chicken yard. “I told the son

Childhood
 
You came into this world trailing clouds all right,
               they just happened to be big black ones.
In the castle you drank from a poisoned goblet
               and were changed into something even bears cringe at.
When you awake baling-wired in thorns,
viceroys around you cobwebbed to their steins,
moth-eaten ermines, a muttering king—
                                               what choice do you have?
Rappel down the turret with your cap and bells.Adolescence
Handed a baton in a bad-luck relay,
you've overshot the cliff and are pinwheeling down,
flailing in time to that whistling-wind keening
that lets viewers know you will soon be compressed
under a subsequent sequence of rocks.
                                               Squashed into pleats a centimeter wide?

                ","
In the heavy fashion magazines strewn here and there around the house the photos of objects and people mouth the word “money,” but you, assuming no one wants you anymore, mishear the message as “meaning.” Arousal follows. The lives of the rich are so fabulous! The destruction of the poetical lies heavily on their hands, as on their swollen notion that we are always watching. There is nothing behind the mask. Nothing suffocating under its pressure, no human essence trying to get out.
     Awareness, always awareness. Don’t you see how these elaborate masks are turning you into a zombie? The private life is not for the eye but for the endless interior. It is trying to push all this crap aside and find the missing line. Nobody, least of all the future, cares about the outcome of this quest.
      It is easy to lose, through meddling or neglect, an entire aspect of existence. And sometimes, to cultivate a single new thought, you need not only silence but an entirely new life.

And this is what is left of youth! . . .There were two boys, who were bred up together,Shared the same bed, and fed at the same board;Each tried the other’s sport, from their first chase,Young hunters of the butterfly and bee,To when they followed the fleet hare, and triedThe swiftness of the bird. They lay besideThe silver trout stream, watching as the sunPlayed on the bubbles: shared each in the storeOf either’s garden: and together readOf him, the master of the desert isle,Till a low hut, a gun, and a canoe,Bounded their wishes. Or if ever cameA thought of future days, ’twas but to sayThat they would share each other’s lot, and doWonders, no doubt. But this was vain: they partedWith promises of long remembrance, wordsWhose kindness was the heart’s, and those warm tears,Hidden like shame by the young eyes which shed them,But which are thought upon in after-yearsAs what we would give worlds to shed once more.
 They met again, — but different from themselves,At least what each remembered of themselves:The one proud as a soldier of his rank,And of his many battles: and the otherProud of his Indian wealth, and of the skillAnd toil which gathered it; each with a browAnd heart alike darkened by years and care.They met with cold words, and yet colder looks:Each was changed in himself, and yet each thoughtThe other only changed, himself the same.And coldness bred dislike, and rivalryCame like the pestilence o’er some sweet thoughtsThat lingered yet, healthy and beautiful,Amid dark and unkindly ones. And they,Whose boyhood had not known one jarring word,Were strangers in their age: if their eyes met,’Twas but to look contempt, and when they spoke,Their speech was wormwood! . . . . . .

                 Happy, who can Appease this virtuous enemy of man!O, then let me in time compound,And parley with those conquering eyes; Ere they have tried their force to wound, Ere, with their glancing wheels, they driveIn triumph over hearts that strive,And them that yield but more despise. 
                 Let me be laid,Where I may see thy glories from some shade.Meantime, whilst every verdant thing Itself does at thy beauty charm, Reform the errors of the spring; Make that the tulips may have share Of sweetness, seeing they are fair; And roses of their thorns disarm:
                 But most procure That violets may a longer age endure.But, O young beauty of the woods,Whom Nature courts with fruits and flowers, Gather the flowers, but spare the buds; Lest Flora angry at thy crime, To kill her infants in their prime, Do quickly make the example yours;

All’s clear and calm save his childhood rushing head- long through tearing thickets, and the sisters, barely glimpsed against reflective flashing, laughing after him, thenlying back to catch all the sullen autumn sun they can.

Grow old along with me! The best is yet to be, The last of life, for which the first was made: Our times are in His hand Who saith ""A whole I planned, Youth shows but half; trust God: see all, nor be afraid!'' Not that, amassing flowers, Youth sighed ""Which rose make ours, Which lily leave and then as best recall?"" Not that, admiring stars, It yearned ""Nor Jove, nor Mars; Mine be some figured flame which blends, transcends them all!"" Not for such hopes and fears Annulling youth's brief years, Do I remonstrate: folly wide the mark! Rather I prize the doubt Low kinds exist without, Finished and finite clods, untroubled by a spark. Poor vaunt of life indeed, Were man but formed to feed On joy, to solely seek and find and feast: Such feasting ended, then As sure an end to men; Irks care the crop-full bird? Frets doubt the maw-crammed beast? Rejoice we are allied To That which doth provide And not partake, effect and not receive! A spark disturbs our clod; Nearer we hold of God Who gives, than of His tribes that take, I must believe. Then, welcome each rebuff That turns earth's smoothness rough, Each sting that bids nor sit nor stand but go! Be our joys three-parts pain! Strive, and hold cheap the strain; Learn, nor account the pang; dare, never grudge the throe! For thence,—a paradox Which comforts while it mocks,— Shall life succeed in that it seems to fail: What I aspired to be, And was not, comforts me: A brute I might have been, but would not sink i' the scale. What is he but a brute Whose flesh has soul to suit, Whose spirit works lest arms and legs want play? To man, propose this test— Thy body at its best, How far can that project thy soul on its lone way? Yet gifts should prove their use: I own the Past profuse Of power each side, perfection every turn: Eyes, ears took in their dole, Brain treasured up the whole; Should not the heart beat once ""How good to live and learn?"" Not once beat ""Praise be Thine! I see the whole design, I, who saw power, see now love perfect too: Perfect I call Thy plan: Thanks that I was a man!    Maker, remake, complete,—I trust what Thou shalt do!"" For pleasant is this flesh; Our soul, in its rose-mesh Pulled ever to the earth, still yearns for rest; Would we some prize might hold To match those manifold Possessions of the brute,—gain most, as we did best! Let us not always say, ""Spite of this flesh to-day I strove, made head, gained ground upon the whole!"" As the bird wings and sings, Let us cry ""All good things Are ours, nor soul helps flesh more, now, than flesh helps soul!"" Therefore I summon age To grant youth's heritage, Life's struggle having so far reached its term: Thence shall I pass, approved A man, for aye removed From the developed brute; a god though in the germ. And I shall thereupon Take rest, ere I be gone Once more on my adventure brave and new: Fearless and unperplexed, When I wage battle next, What weapons to select, what armour to indue. Youth ended, I shall try My gain or loss thereby; Leave the fire ashes, what survives is gold: And I shall weigh the same, Give life its praise or blame: Young, all lay in dispute; I shall know, being old. For note, when evening shuts, A certain moment cuts The deed off, calls the glory from the grey: A whisper from the west Shoots—""Add this to the rest, Take it and try its worth: here dies another day."" So, still within this life, Though lifted o'er its strife, Let me discern, compare, pronounce at last, This rage was right i' the main, That acquiescence vain: The Future I may face now I have proved the Past."" For more is not reserved To man, with soul just nerved To act to-morrow what he learns to-day: Here, work enough to watch The Master work, and catch Hints of the proper craft, tricks of the tool's true play. As it was better, youth Should strive, through acts uncouth, Toward making, than repose on aught found made: So, better, age, exempt From strife, should know, than tempt Further. Thou waitedst age: wait death nor be afraid! Enough now, if the Right And Good and Infinite Be named here, as thou callest thy hand thine own With knowledge absolute, Subject to no dispute From fools that crowded youth, nor let thee feel alone. Be there, for once and all, Severed great minds from small, Announced to each his station in the Past! Was I, the world arraigned, Were they, my soul disdained, Right? Let age speak the truth and give us peace at last! Now, who shall arbitrate? Ten men love what I hate, Shun what I follow, slight what I receive; Ten, who in ears and eyes Match me: we all surmise, They this thing, and I that: whom shall my soul believe? Not on the vulgar mass Called ""work,"" must sentence pass, Things done, that took the eye and had the price; O'er which, from level stand, The low world laid its hand, Found straightway to its mind, could value in a trice: But all, the world's coarse thumb And finger failed to plumb, So passed in making up the main account; All instincts immature, All purposes unsure, That weighed not as his work, yet swelled the man's amount: Thoughts hardly to be packed Into a narrow act, Fancies that broke through language and escaped; All I could never be, All, men ignored in me, This, I was worth to God, whose wheel the pitcher shaped. Ay, note that Potter's wheel, That metaphor! and feel Why time spins fast, why passive lies our clay,— Thou, to whom fools propound, When the wine makes its round, ""Since life fleets, all is change; the Past gone, seize to-day!"" Fool! All that is, at all, Lasts ever, past recall; Earth changes, but thy soul and God stand sure: What entered into thee, That was, is, and shall be: Time's wheel runs back or stops: Potter and clay endure. He fixed thee mid this dance Of plastic circumstance, This Present, thou, forsooth, wouldst fain arrest: Machinery just meant To give thy soul its bent, Try thee and turn thee forth, sufficiently impressed. What though the earlier grooves, Which ran the laughing loves Around thy base, no longer pause and press? What though, about thy rim, Skull-things in order grim Grow out, in graver mood, obey the sterner stress? Look not thou down but up! To uses of a cup, The festal board, lamp's flash and trumpet's peal, The new wine's foaming flow, The Master's lips a-glow! Thou, heaven's consummate cup, what need'st thou with earth's wheel? But I need, now as then, Thee, God, who mouldest men; And since, not even while the whirl was worst, Did I,—to the wheel of life With shapes and colours rife, Bound dizzily,—mistake my end, to slake Thy thirst: So, take and use Thy work: Amend what flaws may lurk, What strain o' the stuff, what warpings past the aim! My times be in Thy hand! Perfect the cup as planned! Let age approve of youth, and death complete the same!

A month, sweet Little-ones, is past Since your dear Mother went away, And she tomorrow will return; Tomorrow is the happy day. O blessed tidings! thoughts of joy! The eldest heard with steady glee; Silent he stood; then laughed amain, And shouted, ‘Mother, come to me!’ Louder and louder did he shout, With witless hope to bring her near! ‘Nay, patience! patience, little boy; Your tender mother cannot hear.’ I told of hills, and far-off towns, And long, long vales to travel through; He listened, puzzled, sore perplexed, But he submits; what can he do? No strike disturbs his sister’s breast; She wars not with the mystery Of time and distance, night and day; The bonds of our humanity. Her joy is like an instinct, joy Of kitten, bird, or summer fly; She dances, runs without an aim, She chatters in her ecstasy. Her brother now takes up the note, And echoes back his sister’s glee; They hug the infant in my arms, As if to force his sympathy. Then, settling into fond discourse, We rested in the garden bower; While sweetly shone the evening sun In his departing hour. We told o’er all that we had done, Our rambles by the swift brook’s side Far as the willow-skirted pool, Where two fair swans together glide. We talked of change, of winter gone, Of green leaves on the hawthorn spray, Of birds that build their nests and sing. And all ‘since Mother went away!’ To her these tales they will repeat, To her our new-born tribes will show, The goslings green, the ass’s colt, The lambs that in the meadow go. — But see, the evening star comes forth! To bed the children must depart; A moment’s heaviness they feel, A sadness at the heart: ’Tis gone — and in a merry fit They run up stairs in gamesome race; I, too, infected by their mood, I could have joined the wanton chase. Five minutes past — and, O the change! Asleep upon their beds they lie; Their busy limbs in perfect rest, And closed the sparkling eye.

to whom existence necessarily pertains.
I also interrogate myself to discover
whether I myself possess any power
by which I can bring it about that I
who now am shall exist another moment.
Because I am mostly a thinking thing
and because this precise question can only
be from that thoughtful part of myself,
if such a power did reside within me
I should, I am sure, be conscious of it. . . .
But I am conscious of no such power.
And yet, if I myself cannot be

it is necessary to conclude that
I am not alone in the world. There is
some other who is the cause of that idea.
But if, at last, no such other can be

They cry for children too tired to cry for themselves,
daughters twelve, eleven, eight—eyes
shutting down as a grate’s banked coals shut down
at midnight, in the rising damp called ‘home.’
Too tired to eat after eighteen hours feeding
looms whose steel teeth grind insatiably,
the girls will be offered up again at dawn.
Yet they are the lucky ones, to work where skylights
hold swatches of the unaffordable blue.
Imagine these girls’ mine-trapped cousins, hauling
black rocks on sledges up tunnels of black air:
half-undressed, belted, harnessed, saturated
with the oil-blackened water they crawl through
pumping ‘the lifeblood of British industry.’
Flogged for talking, Margaret Comeley, aged
nine, can sometimes close her mouth around
a piece of muffin—if she manages
to keep it from the rats, ‘so ravenous
they eat the corks out of our oil-flasks.’
Sarah Gooder fills her mouth with song
‘when I’ve light, but not in the dark; I dare not then.’2.
Here is a working girl so filled with light
she is pure song: her sun-bright bodice shines
in counterpoint with her blue overskirt,
and, from her forehead’s crescent of white linen,
tapering light blazes a white path
down arms and wrists to folds of spread blue cloth,
like moonlight piloting the tide’s refrains.
A Dutch milkmaid, Tanneke Everpoel,
lucky enough to live in the Delft house
where Vermeer’s eye and brush could catch the spill
of morning light as her brief peacefulness
brimmed over, serves here as a celebrant—
bread heaped up on the altar-like table,
wine transubstantiated into milk
whose brilliance seems the source of the room’s light
she pours forever from the earthenware’s
black core. His pose; yet—all hers—underneath it
(and signalled in her fixed eyes’ unconcern
for the beholder) such complete immersion
in what she does, that she is all she does
and it is she, this offering-up of day.
And he? When he was forty, the Sun King
invaded Holland. No one wanted art.
In debt to his baker for three years’ worth of bread,
Vermeer, according to his widow, falling
‘into a frenzy,’ passed ‘from being healthy’
in ‘a day or a day and a half ... to being dead,’
‘the very great burden of his children ... so taken to heart.’3.
Knowing the earth is closer to the sun
in winter won’t revive the street person
sleeping towards cold death in a bus shelter.
Bread in a painting won’t cure stomach ache.
So Margaret dragged her great burden of coal
while Sarah sat terrified in the dark,
and neither knew Vermeer’s poised working girl,
broke bread with her, shared her breaking light.
The painting stood by, helpless to save them
or him, and looking at it now cannot
help anyone. Yet, it can cry for them,
as parents take their children’s grief to heart:
the beads of salt, shimmering on the bread
like diamonds, can be tears the two girls shed
down where no light sang their preciousness.
The cradled pitcher’s brim can be their hearth,
since it (and not the sky’s cold mine of stars)
pours out what cannot shelter us, but feeds
a hunger no daily bread can fill: for light—
light that, like coal, comes from our earth; hunger
that, unlike grief, is inexhaustible.

their cords tentacles drooping from rusty shelves.
It was as if my eyes were painting, not seeing, what I saw,
my memory slowly building the scene until it assembled whole.
What face did my face put on in the midst of transfiguration?
I know what the eyes of the men my age said, settled now
in comfortable middle age, about the life I left behind.
True, I did envy them the asceticism of their grace,
where a given horizon becomes a birthright—to drive or walk
past the same hills all your life, to eat from the same tree
and drink from the well that gave you your name.

Though for centuries the locals broke the statues’
limbs and ground them to make primitive pottery,
enough remains to echo all that has disappeared:
you and the woman leave the towpath, and you brace her
against the trunk of an oak. It’s not the moonlight, but refractions
from suburban homes trapped under cloud-cover
that make her bronze skin glow among glistening trees.
First, God made love:   
                         the canopy like the inside of an emerald,
her lips a rush of cochineal. Then a route of evanescence
brought her from Carthage into these living arms, here.

“A nice time, “ he tells us, how he and four
cousins crossed the desert heading home
on top of three-years’ worth of meager pay
(the tarp ballooning, a giant dough) roped to a truck.
Wearing the goggles of the welder he'd hoped
to become, he looked at the sky and wondered “what
those flying, smoke on their tails, thought of us.”
Later, deported in a cargo plane, he handed
the Tuareg soldiers one of his fake passports,
and they like “space aliens” (in shabby uniforms,
sunglasses, tribal veils) poured into his face.
As the propellers’ hammering calmed to
a shuddering hum, he saw the stars, “hundreds
of them like gnats” swarm Mt. Akakous’ peak.
“My next road is the water,” he says serving
us tonight, and we promise, if the coffee is good,
to put him on the next boat to the moon
                                                shining over Syracuse.

Suddenly, I find your descendant’s hands leafing through
my chapters, scribbling a note in the margin of my thoughts:
            “How is it,” he asks, “that starlight announces the hour:
             how can a song divide desire in two?”
“My flame,” I must have written or said, “coated her body
like silk, one kiss spreading threads of lightening
into her pores, until she became a sob, barely lifted by the wind,
and I became mist, the shadow of a statue at the break of dawn.”
             To that he responds, “a Platonic echo;” and
             “What will come of such a plasticine love?”
Marcus Aurelius, your descendent knows I’ll leave
as I arrive, so empty he gets lost in me.
7.
Two centuries ago, one of my ancestors sat
on one of the communal latrines in mid-morning
and listened to Apuleius’s defense. Across from him
on that marble hexagon, sat two other men.
On normal days they’d have talked about the olive harvest,
the feast of Venus coming soon. But today they listen to
the Madaurian’s high eloquence studded with jokes,
cracking their own one-liners, shaking their heads in delight.
Away from the hot midday sun and the throngs,
you could say, they had the best seats in the house,
and so they lingered and heard as much as they could
then went about their business. So what if a man maries
an older woman for her money, what impoverished young Roman
in his right mind wouldn’t do that? And sure too, if some man
comes to take your inheritance, even if he’s your best friend,
even if he takes good care of your mother, you’d be a fool
not to sue him to the Council, even if you’d have to accuse him
falsely of black magic. That’s the beauty of it, or rather,
whoever is going to win will have to make us trust beauty,
that things being already right, can be more right, which
is what “beautiful” really means. And what better way,
to take in all this refinement than hearing it in a latrine
where only beauty shields you from the awful stuff of life.
8.
Marcus Aurelius, the men at the shore follow your path
into eternity, though they already see their journey
as a quarrel with circumstance, their lives abscesses feeding
on the universe’s hide, tumors in detention camps,
in basement kitchens. Their pockets filled with drachmas,
they’ll lift diffident heads and drag feet lead-heavy with shame.
One of them is now driving a taxi in Thessaloniki or Perugia.
With enough of the language to understand direction, he engages
his late night passengers. In the light of the dashboard
they’ll entrust him with their secrets. With time, he’ll become
a light unto himself, his car a winged chariot of human folly,
and his responses to them saplings nourished in the dark
soil of philosophy. It’s the gift of seasons that stray
from the earth, when soul reigns incidental to flesh,
forgiving to no end, a light that has long surpassed itself.
9.
The birds that drew the line to the first distance
remain nameless to me—
creamy white breasts, gold dust around their eyes,
black/brown (dark roast) wings.
The deserts they crossed, the plains east
or north of here fall like sand from my hands.Um Bsisi, I want to call them, citizens of a protracted destiny,
native and stranger, prodigal and peasant—
admit now, they you’re none of these,
that you’re not any,
                        or even all of them combined.
10.
Southwest of here is Apuleius’s hometown, his inescapable
destination having spent his inheritance on travel and studies.
“Lacking the poverty of the rich,” he’s splurged,
a month-long trip to the Olympic games; and openhanded,
he gifted his mentors their daughters’ doweries.
Few return to Madaura once gone, and when heading back
shamefaced like him, they’d do as he did, taking
the longest route hoping the journey would never end. Here
in Sabratha, the widow hooked him, or he let her reel him,
and that’s how that sordid business happily ended as it began.
I look out toward Madaura, my back to the theater
and the latrines, Madaura birthplace of Augustine, site of
his first schooling—little Augustine holding a satchel of scrolls
and a  loaf of bread for the teacher, awakened by his mother,
his tiny feet cold in tiny sandals, his stomach warm
with a barley porridge my grandmother used to make, forced
to slurp it, sweetened with honey from the Atlas, a sprinkling
of cinnamon and crushed almonds from the family farm.
If the world is that sweet and warm, if it is that mothering,
why then this perpetual scene of separation, this turning
out into the cold toward something he knew he’d love?
He lets go of the neighbors’ boy’s hand warming his own.
He refuses the warm porridge forever, renounces
his mother’s embrace. It only lasted a month,
this partial answer, because even then everyone knew
that the sweet fruit they grew housed the bitterest seeds,
that piety is its own reward while belief only darkens
and deepens like the sea before them, a place
meant for those seeking life other than on this dry earth.
That’s why prophets were welcomed here, calmly,
because God was like rain and they like the saplings
which know only the first verse to the sky’s rainless hymn.
And that’s why Africa’s tallest minaret looms unfinished,
visible from the next town over, and for fifty leagues from the sea if
it were turned into a lighthouse for the ships that no longer come.
The merchant who’d built it, money made from smuggling
subsidized goods to Carthage and used Renaults from Rotterdam,
ran out of money, could not afford the mosque that was to stand
next to it, leaving its gray concrete bleaching in the sun.
There’s enough history here to enable anyone to finish the thought.
It’s useless then to track the fate of these travelers,
some, without life jackets, had never learned how to swim.
Why not let them live in text as they do in life?—they’ve lived
without words for so long—why not release them
from the pen’s anchor and let them drift to their completion?
11.
In a few weeks you’ll see pedants here with binoculars
trying to catch a glimpse of the Ramadan crescent,
and if these migrants stick around here
time will belong to the departure of other travelers,
flocks of Um Bsisi follwing the sun’s arch,
Japanese and Korean trawlers sailing to Gibraltar
or Suez chasing the last herring or sardine.
Where is she now in her time?—
her life dissolved in other people’s minutes,
a sense of solitude her diligent companion
even when she lets go of herself to kindness.
He’ll be there when she returns from the party,
he’ll lie beside her when she sleeps. He’ll say,
“Time belongs to the species, but your life belongs to me.”
She’ll laugh at his words, and remember what you,
Marcus Aurelius, had said about losing only the moment
at hand, how it circles in a ring of dead nerves,
how we stand impoverished before what is to come.
She’ll have her answer to your elocution;
she’d always had an answer for you,
one she refuses to share even with herself.
12.
At last they set to sail. They slaughter a rooster,
douse blood on the Dido figurehead adorning the prow.
The seadog opens a canvas bag and pulls out a hookah.
His Egyptian assistant fills the smoke chamber with seawater,
twists the brass head into it, caking the slit with sand.
He fills the clay bowl with apple-flavored tobacco,
wraps it with foil, pokes it tenderly with a knife.
He picks embers from the going fire, places a few
on the aluminum crown, and inhales and blows
until the bottom vessel fills with a pearly fog,
the color of semen, I think, then hands the pipe hose
to the seadog who inhales his fill and hands it over
to the travelers in turn. The air smells sweet around us,
the breeze blows it away and brings it back tinged with iodine.
Their communion done, they embark except the one who
stands, the dead rooster in his hand, as if wanting
to entrust it to us, then digs a hurried hole to bury it in.
The boat, barely visible, leaves a leaden lacey ribbon
aiming directly for the burnt orange sun. As it reddens,
for a moment, their standing silhouettes eclipse it.
Then the sea restores its dominion, dark as the coffee cooling
in our cups. Dangling from the vine arbor, the lights reflect
a constellation on the table’s dark top. I trace my fingers among them,
hoping conjecture would shine on the mind’s calculus.
Between my unquiet eddies, Marcus Aurelius,
and the coursing water, the travelers’ moment sails,
its tentacles sewing a rupture I had nursed for too long.

It once might have been, once only:
   We lodged in a street together,You, a sparrow on the housetop lonely,
   I, a lone she-bird of his feather.
 Your trade was with sticks and clay,
   You thumbed, thrust, patted and polished,Then laughed ""They will see some day
   Smith made, and Gibson demolished.""
 My business was song, song, song;
   I chirped, cheeped, trilled and twittered,""Kate Brown's on the boards ere long,
   And Grisi's existence embittered!""
 I earned no more by a warble
   Than you by a sketch in plaster;You wanted a piece of marble,
   I needed a music-master.
 We studied hard in our styles,
   Chipped each at a crust like Hindoos,For air looked out on the tiles,
   For fun watched each other's windows.
 You lounged, like a boy of the South,
   Cap and blouse—nay, a bit of beard too;Or you got it, rubbing your mouth
   With fingers the clay adhered to.
 And I—soon managed to find
   Weak points in the flower-fence facing,Was forced to put up a blind
   And be safe in my corset-lacing.
 No harm! It was not my fault
   If you never turned your eye's tail upAs I shook upon E in alt,
   Or ran the chromatic scale up:
 For spring bade the sparrows pair,
   And the boys and girls gave guesses,And stalls in our street looked rare
   With bulrush and watercresses.
 Why did not you pinch a flower
   In a pellet of clay and fling it?Why did not I put a power
   Of thanks in a look, or sing it?
 I did look, sharp as a lynx,
   (And yet the memory rankles,)When models arrived, some minx
   Tripped up-stairs, she and her ankles.
 But I think I gave you as good!
   ""That foreign fellow,—who can knowHow she pays, in a playful mood,
   For his tuning her that piano?""
 Could you say so, and never say
   ""Suppose we join hands and fortunes,And I fetch her from over the way,
   Her, piano, and long tunes and short tunes?""
 No, no: you would not be rash,
   Nor I rasher and something over:You've to settle yet Gibson's hash,
   And Grisi yet lives in clover.
 But you meet the Prince at the Board,
   I'm queen myself at bals-paré,I've married a rich old lord,
   And you're dubbed knight and an R.A.
 Each life unfulfilled, you see;
   It hangs still, patchy and scrappy:We have not sighed deep, laughed free,
   Starved, feasted, despaired,—been happy.
 And nobody calls you a dunce,

I used to like being young, and I still do,Because I think I still am. There are physicalObjections to that thought, and yet whatFascinates me now is how obsessed I was at thirty-fiveWith feeling older than I was: it seemed so smartAnd worldly, so fastidiously knowing to dwell so muchOn time — on what it gives, what it destroys, on how it feels.And now it’s here and doesn’t feel like anything at all:A little warm perhaps, a little cool, but mostly waiting on myLife to fill it up, and meanwhile living in the light and listeningTo the music floating through my living room each night.It’s something you can only recognize in retrospect, long afterEverything that used to fill those years has disappearedAnd they’ve become regrets and images, leaving you aloneIn a perpetual present, in a nondescript small room where it began.You find it in yourself: the ways that led inexorably fromHome to here are simply stories now, leading nowhere anymore;The wilderness they led through is the space behind a doorThrough which a sentence flows, following a map in the heart.Along the way the self that you were born with turns intoThe self that you created, but they come together at the end,United in the memory where time began: the tinkling of a bellOn a garden gate in Combray, or the clang of a driven nailIn a Los Angeles backyard, or a pure, angelic clang in Nova Scotia — Whatever age restores. It isn’t the generalizations that I lovedAt thirty-five that move me now, but particular momentsWhen my life comes into focus, and the feeling of the yearsBetween them comes alive. Time stops, and then resumes its story,Like a train to Balbec or a steamer to Brazil. We moved to San Diego,Then I headed east, then settled in the middle of the countryWhere I’ve waited now for almost forty years, going through theMotions of the moments as they pass from now to nothing,Reading by their light. I don’t know why I’m reading them again — Elizabeth Bishop, Proust. The stories you remember feel like mirrors,And rereading them like leafing through your life at a certain age,As though the years were pages. I keep living in the lightUnder the door, waiting on those vague sensations floating inAnd out of consciousness like odors, like the smell of sperm and lilacs.In the afternoon I bicycle to a park that overlooks Lake Michigan,Linger on a bench and read Contre Sainte-Beuve and Time Reborn,A physics book that argues time is real. And that’s my life — It isn’t much, and yet it hangs together: its obsessions dovetailWith each other, as the private world of my experience takes its placeWithin a natural order that absorbs it, but for a while lets it live.It feels like such a miracle, this life: it promises everything,And even keeps its promise when you’ve grown too old to care.It seems unremarkable at first, and then as time goes by itStarts to seem unreal, a figment of the years inside a universeThat flows around them and dissolves them in the end,But meanwhile lets you linger in a universe of one — A village on a summer afternoon, a garden after dark,A small backyard beneath a boring California sky.I said I still felt young, and so I am, yet what that meansEludes me. Maybe it’s the feeling of the presenceOf the past, or of its disappearance, or both of them at once — A long estrangement and a private singularity, intactWithin a tinkling bell, an iron nail, a pure, angelic clang — The echo of a clear, metallic sound from childhood,Where time began: “Oh, beautiful sound, strike again!”

It was not kindness, but I was only buckle-high in the door.
I let him in because the knock had come, the rain
clawed each window and wall. I was afraid.
Climbing down the stairs I did not know
how my country, cunningly, had rotted,
but hear, now, my steps creak in memory
and the rocks let go in the blind nightglass
where you get up, frightened, to reenact
the irrational logic of flesh.
Even now I can’t see why it happens, the moment of change,
but must try to witness each particular index
of landscape and irony of promise. I know
I was a child when the banging began, sleepless
with every light in the house blazing. Then
the man whose speech entangled me came in
from the mud-world. He could not
put together the clear words of hope
we dream, only the surge of a river.
He, who said it wasn’t a fit thing
for anyone, half-grown, to have to imagine in this godforsaken
life, said there was a message, the river high,
no chance. I remember the wind at that door
breaking like a father’s hand on my face.
Such hurting does not cease and maybe
that is why the man went on fumbling
for love, for the loving words
that might be knowledge. He gave me
this message. I took it, and took, without warning, grief’s
language that piece by piece has shown me how
to connect dreamed moments skidding like rocks
in the silence of a Wyoming midnight.
Each of his rainy words, fragments
of the old sickness, passed into me,
then he was gone, miserable and emptied,
and I had no home but the heart’s hut,
the blistering walls of loneliness,
the world’s blue skymiles of longing.
Common with drowned fir and uncoiling crocus, then, I
walked in ignorance and entered this terrible life
that was always a dream of the future
in the relentless unsleep of those
who cannot remember the last thing they wanted
to say: that love exists. And in darkness
you have dreamed me into your world
with their message, their words
whispering an hour before black, sudden knocking
that, even as I recall it, begins in your heart’s meat
to reverberate, oh, its noise is going
to wake you like a dove’s desire.
This is the dream of the soft buckling
of flesh, the beautiful last erosions,
and I swear I would give up these words
if I could, I would stop the code
of that streetlight just beyond your bed—
but it is too late, for the secret of hope swells in you
and who can stop the news that already screams
like the roof’s edge leaving its nails
over your child’s bed that is, now,
splintered and empty as every moment
skidding at the back of your neck? Leaves
not a month old hurl out of the storm
and steady splatter of time, and tomorrow
will lie still ripening, but only long enough
for you to catalog, in dream, what was possible
before the rake must drag its scritch-scratch over ground.
All I ask is that you turn to the child
inside, those words dreaming and changeless
as love’s last chance—let them be said
against whatever, crying in the night,
we still think may be stopped, the black
historical fact of life’s event
crashing, like a wall of water,
over the actuary’s lawn and yours.
You have seen me before and would not hear, stung by your
wife’s fierce beauty, when I called your name,
and the day your mother died I begged
your attention and got your dollar.
I followed you once, in New York, like truth,
always to give you the message, and now
on your porch, mud-spattered, I am
knocking to make you see what love is.
Call your wife, the police, anyone you like,
for everyone is waiting. We don’t mean to be unkind but are
compelled to deliver, faithfully, the words
that have been fluttering in your ear
like a scream. It is not the wind
waking you, but the low roar of years
fumbling to tell you what has happened,
or will, when the door flies open
and the naked message of love
stands there stuttering in your face,
alive, crying, leaving nothing out.

Highness, the former walls were helpless. They
stood alone in the middle of small fields
protecting nothing. A single peasant’s holding
engulfed each one as it ran briefly, straight
from noplace off to noplace, with ruinous steps
of broken stone at both ends. Only head-high,
without the towers, gates and towns of your great wall,
they stuck where they were, never rising over hills
or curving through valleys: nothing but shoddy masonry
and a mystery: who built them, how long ago,
what for? They seemed to have no role but balking
the reaper and the ox; their bases made
islands in the flashing scythe-strokes, where wild flowers
and shrubs sprouted.
                               So all the people praise you
for burying such walls and their memory
in your vast one, which joins them, stretching far
beyond where they once crumbled to hold your Empire:
a wall which therefore can never have an end
but has to go on extending itself forever.
How useful, how cogent your wall is: a pale
for the civilized, a dike against the wild people
outside, who trade their quiet human blood
for the rage of gods, tearing men to pieces,
throwing them, watching them fall. In burying
those little walls, Lord, you have covered our shame
at our ancestors, best forgotten, whose mighty works
were so pointless, or so pitiably useless.
Was all their effort so that daisies could grow in fissures?
So that some human work would rise over the flats
and weather till it seemed not human? Only
so that something of ours could be like trees and rocks:
docile-seeming, yet sullenly opposed
to use, and when compelled, only half serving,
reserving from the functions that we give them
a secret and idle self. The peasants would make
lean-tos for cattle against those walls: they served
for this alone.
                        Now scholars, Lord, are saying
the gods are not bulls and cows. That in ancient times
we herded these animals to keep from starving
and going naked, and so came the old custom
of thinking them gods—from dependence. In my youth,
I know, the peasants said just the opposite.
Worship came first. The awesome bull and cow
were gathered to be adored more easily,
till people noticed how they let themselves
be driven and penned. Next came the first murders
against these gods, and the careful observation
that they stood to be killed. And so their cult became
contempt of beings that would live with us
and submit to our crimes and hunger, and we began
to breed them. That is why, the farmer says,
cattle are honoured, murdered, eaten, cherished
with labour that makes him their slave, and that is why
in summer he exults in blood, but shivers with fear,
with exhausted terror and regret, and sinks into
stunned revelry all winter, eating the salted meat,
getting children, his house closed up with snow,
himself awake as if he slept, living
as if he had already died, and rich, happy
as if he were a buried worm.
                                           Is God,
then, Highness, the fat flaccidity of cattle?
Myself, I don’t like to wonder anymore.
I only hope lifelong service earns what I ask:
the command of some far bastion on your wall
where it curves out into the unsettled wastes
beyond any field, and the barrenness inside
is indistinguishable from that without.
This is the reward and end of life I want:
to be a point, though infinitely small
and far from you, in that wide circle centred
on your great self. I see myself arriving
to take charge of my troops. I look down from the tower:
bare plains, outcrops of ice and rock, vast restless
stirrings of grey grasses and dark-veined overcast,
the cold wind’s hissing. Year after year the same,
waiting for an assault that never comes,
straining to glimpse our naked enemies
creeping blended with their stony soil: nothing
but legend, it may be. Maybe a morning
will rise when, waking, I find that I’ve forgotten
which way is north, and can’t tell if I am turned
outward to danger or inward, Highness, to you.
The sun invisible, a murky light diffused
throughout featureless cloud, and the wall so long
no curve appears—it seems to stretch out straight
endlessly east and west: what clue will there be
which way to face my people for the attack?
It will be crucial then to show no doubt.
My orders, I vow, though ignorant, will be crisp.

                    What I Know
                ","
1. I know that language is within the world and that, at the same time, the world is within language. I know we are at the border between language and the world.   
2. I don’t like phrases such as “nothing new under the sun” or “it’s all been said already.” I know that at every moment we could affirm: “everything is always new under the sun” or “almost nothing has yet been said of what could be said.”   
3. I know that there’s no true coherence except in apparent incoherence. Every object clothes itself in chaos. To take shape, every thought must manage its own vagueness.   
4. Among the obvious: I know that every human activity consists, one way or another, of battling death.   
5. I know that time is bound up with space. Time is the shadow of space. Space the shadow of time. I know that we live in the shadow of a shadow and that it returns to the light.   
6. I know that I know nothing about love.   
7. I know that I live not in the world, but in the shadow of the world. I know that I go through the world the way an insect goes through its entire life in the shadow of a bank.   
8. I know that nothing is simple. Or more, that what’s simple is never truly, never completely, so. I know that everything adds up and that every element of this total depends on the whole.   
9. I know that everything around me is nothing but a mass of contingency. I know that every word props itself up on an immense architecture of contingency.
10. I know that thunder comes after lightning and sometimes, in my dreams, thunder precedes lightning. I know that to see its opposite simultaneously with every phenomenon you must widen your eyes.   
11. I know that whoever finds himself loses himself a little.   
12. I know that I love a woman enormously, but I don’t know which one.   
13. I know that to talk is to walk a path with emptiness to the right and emptiness to the left. I know that nothing can grasp this path with two ends. I know that writing is talking in frozen time.   
14. I know that the word “table” is like a thousand tables. That a phrase is like a thousand thousand phrases. And that thinking is a match for water sports.   
15. I know that every authentic poet is in decay.   
16. To read isn’t necessarily to analyze, is not necessarily “to understand.” At the swimming pool, we don’t ask the swimmer the composition of the water, the number and distribution of swimmers, or why he’s picked this date to go swimming. We don’t ask him to describe, in mid-crawl, the architecture or acoustics of the place, or to explain a bird trapped under its roof, or to do a better imitation of the progress of some Olympic seal. We don’t ask him to memorize opening hours or screw himself up by whistling from the bench throughout an entire race in butterfly stroke. No. Finally, we don’t ask him, before each dive, to bring up some secret meaning from the very bottom of the pool. No. We let swimmers swim. We let swimmers swim. And the swimming pools fill up.   
17. I know that I live and think inside a storehouse of books. Some recent, new, remarkable books, but in the great majority books which are decayed, moldy, have turned to the lightest heaps of dust. Only their metal frames and some fine particles of knowledge remain, unusable. Light from a few windows crosses the storehouse unimpeded.   
18. Having found some daguerreotypes on the floor of an attic—portraits eroded by time and light—I know that forgetting is something enormous, that forgetting is our highest destiny.   
19. I know that God doesn’t exist. That’s written everywhere in the storehouse—it can be made out through the portholes, too. I know that after death there’s nothing but death.   
20. I know that, seen from the border between language and the world, the universe is in increasing entropy. But I no longer know what it is if I climb to the top of a tree (one of these trees on the border between language and the world), from where you can see far into language and far into the world at the same time.   
21. Because I have scaled a tree, I know that beyond language is a huge plain, with dark flowers and little mazy footpaths.

At the Mind Museum, you can walk to the back,step on several large buttons on the ground,and watch parts of the brain light up: the frontal lobefor decision and memory, the temporal lobefor smell and sound, the occipital for sight.

I know what she was trying to get across,  and I don’t doubt it would be healthier  if we were more familiar than we are  with how the natural world draws life from loss;  and granted, nothing is more natural  than death incarnate falling from the sky;  and granted, it is better some should die,  however agonizingly, than all.  Still, to teach children this is how things go  is one thing, to insist that it is good  is something else—it is to make a god  of an unsatisfactory status quo,  this vicious circle that the clock hands draw  and quarter, while the serpent bites its tail,  or eats the dust, or strikes at someone’s heel,  or winds up comprehended by a claw.

Where is your father whose eye you were the apple of?Where are your mother’s parlor portieres, her slip-covered days, her petticoats?In the orchard at the other end of  time, you were just a child in ballet slippers,Your first poodle skirt, your tortoiseshell barrettes. As the peach tree grew more Scarce each day, you kept running out to try to tape the leaves back on their boughs.Once, I caught you catch a pond of sunlight in your lap and when you stood, The sunlight spilt; it could never follow you. Once, above the river, You told me you were born to be a turtle, swimming down. Under the bridge Now you take your meals where the thinnest creatures live at the endOf the world. Carpe Demon, you told me just before you put down the phone And drank the antifreeze. This year, the winter sky in Missouri is a kind of coldThe color of a turtle’s hood, a soup of dandelion, burdock root, and clay.

What are we first? First, animals; and next   Intelligences at a leap; on whom   Pale lies the distant shadow of the tomb,   And all that draweth on the tomb for text.   Into which state comes Love, the crowning sun:   Beneath whose light the shadow loses form.   We are the lords of life, and life is warm.   Intelligence and instinct now are one.   But nature says: ""My children most they seem   When they least know me: therefore I decree   That they shall suffer."" Swift doth young Love flee,   And we stand wakened, shivering from our dream.

Among twenty snowy mountains,   
The only moving thing   
Was the eye of the blackbird.   II
I was of three minds,   
Like a tree   
In which there are three blackbirds.   III
The blackbird whirled in the autumn winds.   
It was a small part of the pantomime.   IV
A man and a woman   
Are one.   
A man and a woman and a blackbird

Or just after.   VI
Icicles filled the long window   
With barbaric glass.   
The shadow of the blackbird   
Crossed it, to and fro.   
The mood   
Traced in the shadow   
An indecipherable cause.   VII
O thin men of Haddam,   
Why do you imagine golden birds?   
Do you not see how the blackbird   
Walks around the feet   
Of the women about you?   VIII
I know noble accents   
And lucid, inescapable rhythms;   
But I know, too,   
That the blackbird is involved   
In what I know.   IX
When the blackbird flew out of sight,   
It marked the edge   
Of one of many circles.   X
At the sight of blackbirds   
Flying in a green light,   
Even the bawds of euphony   
Would cry out sharply.   XI
He rode over Connecticut   
In a glass coach.   
Once, a fear pierced him,   
In that he mistook   
The shadow of his equipage   
For blackbirds.   XII
The river is moving.   
The blackbird must be flying.   XIII
It was evening all afternoon.   
It was snowing   
And it was going to snow.   
The blackbird sat   
In the cedar-limbs.

Ah! why, because the dazzling sunRestored my earth to joyHave you departed, every one,And left a desert sky?All through the night, your glorious eyesWere gazing down in mine,And with a full heart's thankful sighsI blessed that watch divine!I was at peace, and drank your beamsAs they were life to meAnd revelled in my changeful dreamsLike petrel on the sea.Thought followed thought—star followed starThrough boundless regions on,While one sweet influence, near and far,Thrilled through and proved us one.Why did the morning rise to breakSo great, so pure a spell,And scorch with fire the tranquil cheekWhere your cool radiance fell?Blood-red he rose, and arrow-straight,His fierce beams struck my brow;The soul of Nature sprang elate,But mine sank sad and low!My lids closed down—yet through their veilI saw him blazing still;And bathe in gold the misty dale,And flash upon the hill.I turned me to the pillow thenTo call back Night, and seeYour worlds of solemn light, againThrob with my heart and me!It would not do—the pillow glowedAnd glowed both roof and floor,And birds sang loudly in the wood,And fresh winds shook the door.The curtains waved, the wakened fliesWere murmuring round my room,Imprisoned there, till I should riseAnd give them leave to roam.O Stars and Dreams and Gentle Night;O Night and Stars return!And hide me from the hostile lightThat does not warm, but burn—That drains the blood of suffering men;Drinks tears, instead of dew:Let me sleep through his blinding reign,And only wake with you!

Last night, the train I was on dimmed then re-electrified,              and I thought again that we are conscious a lot less often than we suppose, that half the time              in us you’re half reposed. I was in South Orange again, city of my former self’s last              stand. Do you remember him, your swallowed twin, the child king whom you deposed? Oh,              I know: you think you’re the buried light, the jeweled glow, the sunlight falling through              the falling snow.

Who else but youstarts each day with masturbation and ends              each night with gin? And so how should I begin? Four years ago, you rose              in me like a fin. It started as an overflow, a drop of go, some royal beast in me, all gasoline              and yeast, unhinging its own jaw to accelerate the feast, the rails of thought so greased              that the outer world began to skew, as in that moment on a train when the view              becomes a wash of hues. There were clues. Phantom music in the air. At times, I’d look down              at my body and think, “How’d you get there?” One day, I de-napped to find myself entrapped              within the tangled logic of a subway map. All day, I’d refrain, I’d double-track.              I’d talk to myself and myself talked back. Was it you? That tick I felt within the trick              of thought? That wick that curled itself around me, not exploding, just making a constant              tick-tick-tick that finally convinced me that I was sick, that there was a cascade of toxins             in the air, that there was something queer about the neighbor’s              stare, that charade of signals everywhere, an air raid in the brain, something in me             left unpaid, a cosmic debt in arrears. Some nights, I’d hear the voices of my parents coming              near, like waves that overlapped—she’d slap him, he’d slap her back—their rage              a single note that climbed its staff for years, my siblings and I in the closet with our fingers              in our ears, though still I heard one night the knife drawer heaved back, as if they really              might slice each other or the house in half, and then my thoughts unweaved and I began              to laugh.

Too heavy to outrun, Too slow to measure what it underwent, Though gradually the passage of the sun, Unmanageable in its train of light, Seemed almost to respond As he yanked the yards of stuff in like a kite And gathered the brocade that trailed beyond His arms' reach to the scale of measurement, However strange the weave That writhed about the working of his hands: The footage too atrocious to believe, Printed with corpses; Greece; the falls of salmon; Her upturned silken wrist He would have torn out history to examine; His father's final blessing, which he missed. However far he comes or where he stands, At last, and limb by limb, Contour by contour, that unfolded cape Settles ever more fittingly on him. His forehead is the line of the sky's vault, His shoulders trace the ground, His palms the ways he wandered by default, And in his gestures those he knew are found.

Hail native language, that by sinews weak Didst move my first endeavouring tongue to speak, And mad'st imperfect words with childish trips, Half unpronounc'd, slide through my infant lips, Driving dumb Silence from the portal door, Where he had mutely sate two years before: Here I salute thee and thy pardon ask, That now I use thee in my latter task: Small loss it is that thence can come unto thee, I know my tongue but little grace can do thee: Thou needst not be ambitious to be first, Believe me I have thither pack'd the worst: And, if it happen as I did forecast, The daintest dishes shall be serv'd up last. I pray thee then deny me not thy aid For this same small neglect that I have made: But haste thee straight to do me once a pleasure, And from thy wardrobe bring thy chiefest treasure; Not those new-fangled toys, and trimming slight Which takes our late fantastics with delight, But cull those richest robes, and gay'st attire Which deepest spirits, and choicest wits desire. I have some naked thoughts that rove about And loudly knock to have their passage out; And weary of their place do only stay Till thou hast deck'd them in thy best array; That so they may without suspect or fears Fly swiftly to this fair assembly's ears. Yet I had rather, if I were to choose, Thy service in some graver subject use, Such as may make thee search thy coffers round, Before thou clothe my fancy in fit sound: Such where the deep transported mind may soar Above the wheeling poles, and at heav'n's door Look in, and see each blissful deity How he before the thunderous throne doth lie, Listening to what unshorn Apollo sings To th'touch of golden wires, while Hebe brings Immortal nectar to her kingly sire; Then passing through the spheres of watchful fire, And misty regions of wide air next under, And hills of snow and lofts of piled thunder, May tell at length how green-ey'd Neptune raves, In heav'n's defiance mustering all his waves; Then sing of secret things that came to pass When beldam Nature in her cradle was; And last of kings and queens and heroes old, Such as the wise Demodocus once told In solemn songs at king Alcinous' feast, While sad Ulysses' soul and all the rest Are held with his melodious harmony In willing chains and sweet captivity.

For the sound of weeping coming from the next room,
Only there’s no next room and we’re the only ones
There, though just for a moment and a lifetime more.
Listen, I will tell you a secret, the secret you told
Me once on the train into the mountains
On the journey to the shore, a time long ago when
We spoke and never met. That secret, which is ours.
Some nights are so long the old dog comes home
To us who remain there waiting and waiting
Even if we’ve never been here before, where we are.

                    Something in the Belly
                ","
I wanted to have a poem and I was pregnant. I was very thin. As if I’d lived on air. A poet must be able to live on air, but a mother must not attempt it. My mother wanted me to buy a set of matching pots, Wearever aluminum, like the ones she had. They were heavy and had well fitting lids so my suppers wouldn’t burn. My husband wanted me to give dinner parties. John F. Kennedy was running for office.
 
I sensed danger. Kennedy wasn’t against the Bomb or for nuclear disarmament. I joined SANE at its inception. Also Concerned Scientists. I spoke with Linus Pauling and encouraged my husband to help his partner organize Physicians for Social Responsibility.
 
There was a baby in my belly. I wanted to write poems. I had a crazy idea that a woman could write a real novel, the kind that shook the world. I hallucinated that a woman could be a poet, but she would have to be free. I couldn’t imagine that freedom for myself even though I could see it in Isla Negra when I followed Pablo Neruda. I could see it in the way he walked. Even if he were walking inside a dictatorship, among guns, soldiers and spies, there was nothing between him and his vision. Anything he saw, he was able to take into himself–there was no sight, no image, no vision to which he didn’t feel entitled. In his heart, everything–everything–belonged to him. Pablo Neruda was–more than anything–a poet, and so he was an entitled man.
 
I was a woman and entitled to nothing. I had nothing except a husband, a rented house, a set of pots, living room furniture, a frenzy of obligations, credit cards, anxious relatives, too many acquaintances, a gift of future diaper service, two telephones, no time to read, a plastic wrapped cookbook of recipes gleaned from the pages of the New York Times, and a hunger, a terrible hunger for the unimaginable, unlimited freedom of being a poet, and a baby in my belly.
 
I would have called Pablo long distance if I had the courage, if I had the ability to speak Spanish fluently, if we had ever talked about real things. But, what would a man know about a baby in the belly? And what did it matter if there were to be one poet more or less in the world when so many in his country were dying?
 
I woke up one morning and thought–I can’t have this child. My husband said, “You’ll have to get a job after it’s born so we can buy a house. You’ll need an advanced degree so you can do something.” I thought, I can’t. I have to write poems. My mother found a crib. Someone painted it white. A friend sent a pastel mobile with tame wood animals. I thought about blue curtains, making bedspreads, and abortions.
 
Pablo was silent. He was walking so far from me, I couldn’t hear him. My husband objected to donating more free medical care to the Black Panthers. I tried to make dolmades from scratch and located grape leaves preserved in brine at the Boys’ Market twenty miles away. I organized a write-in campaign for peace to challenge JFK. My husband thought it would be nice to have teatime with the children and romantic dinners by ourselves. The new formula bottles lined up on the sink like tiny bombs. The U.S. was pursuing over ground testing; I was afraid the radiation would cross the milk barrier. I had a poem in me howling for real life but no language to write in. The fog came in thick, flapping about my feet like blankets unraveling. I became afraid to have a daughter.
 
I called Pablo Neruda in the middle of the night as he walked underwater by Isla Negra. He moved like a dream porpoise. He seemed pregnant with words. They came out of his penis in long miraculous strings. The sea creatures quivered with joy. I said, “Pablo, I want to know how to bear the child in my belly onto this bed of uranium and I want to know if a woman can a be a poet.” He was large as a whale. He drank the sea and spouted it in glistening odes, black and shiny. I said, “I can’t have this child,” and he laughed as if he had never done anything but carry and birth children.
 
So I packed my little bag as if I were going to the hospital and I left a note and the Wearever pots and sterilized nipples upon the glass missiles, and took the cradle board than an American Indian friend had given me for the baby and that had made my husband snort– “You’re not going to carry the thing on your back, are you?” I took some money, the car, some books, paper and pens, my walking shoes, an unwieldly IBM electric typewriter, my pregnant belly and a dozen cloth diapers, and I went out.
 
I knew how to carry a baby and how to carry a poem and I would learn how to have a baby and even how to have a poem. I would have enough milk for both. I would learn how to walk with them. But I didn’t know, and I didn’t want to know, how to have a husband and a matched set of Wearever pots.

I. WHAT was he doing, the great god Pan,     Down in the reeds by the river ? Spreading ruin and scattering ban, Splashing and paddling with hoofs of a goat, And breaking the golden lilies afloat     With the dragon-fly on the river. II. He tore out a reed, the great god Pan,     From the deep cool bed of the river : The limpid water turbidly ran, And the broken lilies a-dying lay, And the dragon-fly had fled away,     Ere he brought it out of the river. III. High on the shore sate the great god Pan,     While turbidly flowed the river ; And hacked and hewed as a great god can, With his hard bleak steel at the patient reed, Till there was not a sign of a leaf indeed     To prove it fresh from the river. IV. He cut it short, did the great god Pan,     (How tall it stood in the river !) Then drew the pith, like the heart of a man, Steadily from the outside ring, And notched the poor dry empty thing     In holes, as he sate by the river. V.  This is the way,' laughed the great god Pan,     Laughed while he sate by the river,)  The only way, since gods began To make sweet music, they could succeed.' Then, dropping his mouth to a hole in the reed,     He blew in power by the river. VI. Sweet, sweet, sweet, O Pan !     Piercing sweet by the river ! Blinding sweet, O great god Pan ! The sun on the hill forgot to die, And the lilies revived, and the dragon-fly     Came back to dream on the river. VII. Yet half a beast is the great god Pan,     To laugh as he sits by the river, Making a poet out of a man : The true gods sigh for the cost and pain, — For the reed which grows nevermore again     As a reed with the reeds in the river.

                    On Anti-Biography
                ","
For me, biography is a lantern, burning in the midst of parenthetical opaqueness. In a sense, it is a ruse, a phantasmic meandering, brighter or dimmer, according to the ecletic happenstance of terror. 
Me, I’ve been sired in anomaly, in an imagery of brewing grenadine riddles, a parallel poesis spawned from curious seismographic molten. I say curious, because the original stalking arc has disappeared into the wilderness of an a priori blizzard, which gives birth to a level, like a portal of fire conjoined with the lightning field of mystery. I call it the poetic guardian dove, the hieratic alien wing. 
It is the non-local field, the non-particle acid, flowing into my cognitive iodine rays, into the vicious fires of my tarantella marshes. So I dance with vibration, with the solar arc spinning backward around the miraculous force of a double green horizon. Simultaneously, I escape the territorial, while remaining within the burning loops of my own momentary seizures, guarded by ferns, legs plowing land, the face and the mind guided by stars. 
So, I am a martyr of drills, of spates of specific lingual flooding, casting at times, a mist or a mirage, like a caravan of yaks, transporting tungsten and water. Conversely, to give a graph of dates, to single out a bevy of personal social lesions, would invert me, would turn me around a diurnal bundle of glass, staggered, with a less than fiery temperature, partially nulling my sensitivity to falling phonemic peppers, to the inclination towards victory which burns in the dawn above heaven. For me, this is the green locale, the pleroma of eternal solar essence, glinting, full of fabulous maelstrom diamonds, an empowered hegira of drift, of claustrophobic rainbow spectrums which empty themselves, and return to themselves, like having an image go out and return to itself, so that its power transmutes by the very energy of its looping; and I think of myself, the poet sending signals into mystery, and having them return to me with oneiric wings and spirals, so much so, that I forget my prosaic locale with its stultifying anchors, with its familial dotage and image reports, with its dates inscribed in trapezoidal feces. I am only concerned with simultaneity and height, with rays of monomial kindling, guiding the neo-cortex through ravens, into the ecstasy of x-rays and blackness.

In her absence I created her image: out of the earthly
the hidden heavenly commences. I am here weighing

a rhyme. Absence teaches me its lesson: If it weren’t
for the mirage you wouldn’t have been steadfast ...
Then in the emptiness, I disassembled a letter from one
of the ancient alphabets, and I leaned on absence. So who am I
after the visitation? A bird, or a passerby amid the symbols
and the memory vendors? As if I were an antique piece,
as if I were a ghost sneaking in from Yabous, telling myself:
Let’s go to the seven hills. Then I placed
my mask on a stone, and walked as the sleepless
walk, led by my dream. And from one moon
to another I leapt. There is enough of unconsciousness

                    Talking to Vladimir Mayakovsky
                ","
All right, I admit it:
                  It was just a dream I had last night.
                                       I was trudging along a muddy path
in a column of downcast men
                  on the blackened outskirts of New York,
                                       the twilight dingy and ruined,
the future without hope
                  as we marched along
                                       in our soiled, proletarian rags.
To my left was Mayakovsky, head shaved,
                  and next to him his friend
                                       with gray beard and dark cap.
""You've got to admit,"" Mayakovsky
                  was saying, ""that this is a pretty good
                                       way to write a poem.""
""Yes,"" I said, ""the momentum
                  is sustained by our walking forward,
                                       the desolate landscape seeps into every word,
and you're free to say anything you want.""
                  ""That's because we're inside the poem,""
                                       he said, ""not outside."" Puddles
of oily water gleamed dully beneath the low clouds.
                  ""That's why my poems were so big:
                                       there's more room inside.""
The hard line of his jaw flexed and
                  the men dispersed. I followed
                                       his friend behind a wall
to hear the poem go on
                  in the lecture the friend was giving on history,
                                       but no, the real poem had finished.
I went back to the spot
                  where the poem had finished.
                                       Vladimir had left the poem.

               June 6, 1857, Thoreau in his Journal:
 
               A year is made up of a certain series               and number of sensations and thoughts               which have their language in nature…

               Or, Clare, 1840, Epping Forest:
                I found the poems in the fields               And only wrote them down
 
               and
 
               The book I love is everywhere               And not in idle words
 
               John, claritas tell us the words are not idle,
               the syllables are able
               to turn plantains into quatrains,
              tune raceme to cyme, panicle and umbel to
              form corollas in light clusters of tones…
 
               Sam Palmer hit it:
               “Milton, by one epithet
               draws an oak of the largest girth I ever saw,
               ‘Pine and monumental oak’:
               I have just been trying to draw a large one in
               Lullingstone; but the poet’s tree is huger than
               any in the park.”

               It was, I think, the third sighting
               in Georgia, and I should have been there
               instead of reading Clare, listening to
               catbirds and worrying about               Turdus migratorious that flew
               directly into the Volkswagen and
               bounced into a ditch

               been going 40 you might be
               whistling in some grass.

Now I begin to know at last, These nights when I sit down to rhyme, The form and measure of that vast God we call Poetry, he who stoops And leaps me through his paper hoops A little higher every time.   Tempts me to think I’ll grow a proper Singing cricket or grass-hopper Making prodigious jumps in air While shaken crowds about me stare Aghast, and I sing, growing bolder To fly up on my master’s shoulder Rustling the thick stands of his hair.   He is older than the seas, Older than the plains and hills, And older than the light that spills From the sun’s hot wheel on these. He wakes the gale that tears your trees, He sings to you from window sills.   At you he roars, or he will coo, He shouts and screams when hell is hot, Riding on the shell and shot. He smites you down, he succours you, And where you seek him, he is not.   To-day I see he has two heads Like Janus—calm, benignant, this; That, grim and scowling: his beard spreads From chin to chin: this god has power Immeasurable at every hour: He first taight lovers how to kiss, He brings down sunshine after shower, Thunder and hate are his also, He is YES and he is NO.   The black beard spoke and said to me, ‘Human fraility though you be, Yet shout and crack your whip, be harsh! They’ll obey you in the end: Hill and field, river and marsh Shall obey you, hop and skip At the terrour of your whip, To your gales of anger bend.’   The pale beard spoke and said in turn ‘True: a prize goes to the stern, But sing and laugh and easily run Through the wide airs of my plain, Bathe in my waters, drink my sun, And draw my creatures with soft song; They shall follow you along Graciously with no doubt or pain.’   Then speaking from his double head The glorious fearful monster said ‘I am YES and I am NO, Black as pitch and white as snow, Love me, hate me, reconcile Hate with love, perfect with vile, So equal justice shall be done And life shared between moon and sun. Nature for you shall curse or smile: A poet you shall be, my son.’

That morning under a pale hood of sky   I heard the unambiguous scrape of spackling   against the side of our wickered, penitential house.   The day mirled and clabbered   in the thick, stony light,   and the rooks’ feathered narling   astounded the salt waves, the plush coast.   I lugged a bucket past the forked   coercion of a tree, up toward   the pious and nictitating preeminence of a school,   hunkered there in its gully of learning.   Only later, by the galvanized washstand,   while gaunt, phosphorescent heifers   swam beyond the windows,   did the whorled and sparky gib of the indefinite   wobble me into knowledge.   Then, I heard the ghost-clink of milk bottle   on the rough threshold   and understood the meadow-bells   that trembled over a nimbus of ragwort—   the whole afternoon lambent, corrugated, puddle-mad.

I wish there had been more stories

            at 17, she went to celebrate being made teacher
            of the one-room school she had attended and
            graduated from at her retiring teacher’s
            home, she was served for the first time — tea, she
            being from a German coffee-drinking family.
            Our mother hated it but politely choked it down.
            Would never again touch a drop of the
            poisonous beverage.
From that story, we learned that
our mother ritualized hating something — expected us
to admire her for it.

left California and reinvented myself, even

You did not become an artist or a poet.
I suppose that’s why you felt damaged.
If only you knew how much imagination and sacrifice
it took for me to get away.
                        So many small things

            not art — 
you thought for a bit, raising your chin.
“A swimming pool in my backyard. One I could
step into every morning, swim, float — maybe in the afternoon
I’d go for a dip. Many evenings, I think,” she said
to me.                     Longing for some ocean?

fleshy occupants. (the ugly parts that die and rot) now

Easter Sunday. You and I always dyed
Easter eggs together, our mother busy at
her forty-hour-a-week bookkeeper’s job. I 
was intrigued with the colors,
but they never turned out so bright when
coloring the eggs. You, the artist,
were interested in the designs
to transfer onto the eggs,
cartoons, bunnies,
chicks.
We kept our eggs
separated from each other,
put them in separate bowls, neither
caring for the other’s creation. Still we
felt connected, even joyful, on those few holiday projects.
Not enough to make us friends.
My unwillingness to be like our classmates
embarrassed you. You chose invisibility
in school, rather than being known as “Diane’s
Sister.” 
That unwillingness to be like others 
was what made me a poet. So many little things, but that early decision
of yours, not to understand why I wanted to be weird,
is what made you make so 
many other small choices, preventing you 
from becoming an artist. “Look away,” our mother said to us,
when there were ugly things confronting us. 
I could not do that. You blame
our mother, yet it was you who decided to look away,
even though it meant not seeing the whole world,
even if meant you didn’t become an artist.
Poverty, of course, was the reason
we never had nice shoes.

Until recent years, my sister

We fought continuously as children.
I have in my wrist a black bump that
protrudes near a vein.
                                    It’s the point of a pencil
that broke off and penetrated my wrist as we struggled
for the long yellow weapon.
A pencil, the weapon of a writer. But there was 
no bleeding, no seeming-wound to be dressed. 
We never told
our Mother, both too ashamed
of our brutality. I’ve never asked a doctor
about it, the pencil lead encapsulated
in my wrist. Nor ever spoken
of it to anyone.
I always wonder that so much must remain a secret?

Drinking
a blend of traditional
Darjeeling with a touch of Ceylon / this
tea takes me back to a Viennese visit, drinking
this very tea in the afternoon while my friend, Jonathan,
ate their famous Sacher torte.
The tea
seemed particularly aromatic — 
            “lightly scented with oil of bergamot
            and a hint of genuine Bourbon vanilla.”
Wishing for the moment in the past to reappear. I didn’t know
the tea from the Sacher Hotel
was as famous as the cake
                                until I found in my Upton Tea catalogue

                                under the heading “Earl Grey Blends”
This tea,
any cup of tea!
Hard to believe. no! Sad to
think my Mother almost spat out her first taste
of tea.
What worldly thing must I touch to
bring Marilyn back into my
sedate life, my sister Marilyn who died in January? 
Her hand — I’d like to imagine timidly touching her
      hand — Marilyn’s hand.
            Her right hand on which she wore the fire opal ring.
                        In that hand she’d be holding a cigarette.
Smoke and fire makes me think of her —

Uncles who burst on childhood, from the East,
Blown from air, like bearded ghosts arriving,

Through mumbled names at dinner-tables moving,
Bearers of parrots, bonfires of blazing stones,
Their pockets fat with riches out of reason,
Meerschaum and sharks’-teeth, ropes of China coins,
And weeds and seeds and berries blowzed with poison—
So, from the baleful Kimberleys of thought,
From the mad continent of dreams, you wander,
Spending your trophies at our bloodless feet,
Mocking our fortunes with more desperate plunder;
So with your boomerangs of rhyme you come,
With blossoms wrenched from sweet and deadly branches,
And we, pale Crusoes in the moment’s tomb,
Watch, turn aside, and touch again those riches,
Nor ask what beaches of the mind you trod,
What skies endured, and unimagined rivers,
Or whiteness trenched by what mysterious tide,
And aching silence of the Never-Nevers;
Watch, turn aside, and touch with easy faith
Your chest of miracles, but counting nothing,
Or dumbly, that you stole them out of death,
Out of death’s pyramids, to prove us breathing.
We breathe, who beat the sides of emptiness,
We live, who die by statute in steel hearses,
We dance, whose only posture gives us grace
To squeeze the greasy udders of our purses—
(Look in this harsher glass, and I will show you
The daylight after the darkness, and the morning
After the midnight, and after the night the day
After the year after, terribly returning).
We live by these, your masks and images,
We breathe in this, your quick and borrowed body;
But you take passage on the ruffian seas,
And you are vanished in the dark already.

Sometimes I want to be:

James looks like a farmboy (Iowa, Iowa, you have more poets than
              scarecrows these fuse-lit days).
How carelessly James sits back on his hips, staring into the camera’s eye.
(Imprisoned inside there is the last surviving Cyclops),
and I think of W. C. W.’s lines:
 
               the beauty of / terrible faces.
 
When my face opens like James’s, it is a year later, years later.
Some life is gone.
Only poems remain.
Perhaps a poem that a magazine wanted to publish before it folded
               (“folded,” the flight of such a word).
And so the poem is stuck on a roll without a player piano.
Imagination insists on saving its works as a poem, a tattoo, a quilt, an
              essay, or an aside, like this one:

Men don’t split into new personae at the command of flashes.
 
We can become fleshless though, like the skeletons in Mexican

I’ll be damned if all those things aren’t moving around in one another’s magnetic fields, some kind of counterpoint that happens each time she breathes    it’s a mobile only no wires    there’s a piece of mirror turning on a spider web and now she’s a    signal beacon    says come on up I’ve got something to read and somehow it all works. Then she pulls this silk thread and it becomes a form.

Another drought morning after a too brief dawn downpour,
unaccountable silvery glitterings on the leaves of the withering maples—
I think of a troop of the blissful blessed approaching Dante,
“a hundred spheres shining,” he rhapsodizes, “the purest pearls…”
then of the frightening brilliants myriad gleam in my lamp
of the eyes of the vast swarm of bats I found once in a cave,
a chamber whose walls seethed with a spaceless carpet of creatures,
their cacophonous, keen, insistent, incessant squeakings and squealings
churning the warm, rank, cloying air; of how one,
perfectly still among all the fitfully twitching others,
was looking straight at me, gazing solemnly, thoughtfully up
from beneath the intricate furl of its leathery wings
as though it couldn’t believe I was there, or were trying to place me,
to situate me in the gnarl we’d evolved from, and now,
the trees still heartrendingly asparkle, Dante again,
this time the way he’ll refer to a figure he meets as “the life of…”
not the soul, or person, the life, and once more the bat, and I,
our lives in that moment together, our lives, our lives,
his with no vision of celestial splendor, no poem,
mine with no flight, no unblundering dash through the dark,
his without realizing it would, so soon, no longer exist,
mine having to know for us both that everything ends,
world, after-world, even their memory, steamed away
like the film of uncertain vapor of the last of the luscious rain.

What is a Jew in solitude?
What would it mean not to feel lonely or afraid
far from your own or those you have called your own?
What is a woman in solitude:   a queer woman or man?
In the empty street, on the empty beach, in the desert
what in this world as it is can solitude mean?
 
The glassy, concrete octagon suspended from the cliffs
with its electric gate, its perfected privacy
is not what I mean
the pick-up with a gun parked at a turn-out in Utah or the Golan Heights
is not what I mean
the poet’s tower facing the western ocean, acres of forest planted to the east, the woman reading in the cabin, her attack dog suddenly risen
is not what I mean
 
Three thousand miles from what I once called home
I open a book searching for some lines I remember
about flowers, something to bind me to this coast as lilacs in the dooryard once
bound me back there—yes, lupines on a burnt mountainside,
something that bloomed and faded and was written down
in the poet’s book, forever:
Opening the poet’s book
I find the hatred in the poet’s heart: . . . the hateful-eyedand human-bodied are all about me: you that love multitude may have them
 
Robinson Jeffers, multitude
is the blur flung by distinct forms against these landward valleys
and the farms that run down to the sea; the lupines
are multitude, and the torched poppies, the grey Pacific unrolling its scrolls of surf,
and the separate persons, stooped
over sewing machines in denim dust, bent under the shattering skies of harvest
who sleep by shifts in never-empty beds have their various dreams
Hands that pick, pack, steam, stitch, strip, stuff, shell, scrape, scour, belong to a brain like no other
Must I argue the love of multitude in the blur or defend
a solitude of barbed-wire and searchlights, the survivalist’s final solution, have I a choice?
 
To wonder far from your own or those you have called your own
to hear strangeness calling you from far away
and walk in that direction, long and far, not calculating risk
to go to meet the Stranger without fear or weapon, protection nowhere on your mind
(the Jew on the icy, rutted road on Christmas Eve prays for another Jew
the woman in the ungainly twisting shadows of the street:   Make those be a woman’s footsteps; as if she could believe in a woman’s god)
 
Find someone like yourself.   Find others.
Agree you will never desert each other.
Understand that any rift among you
means power to those who want to do you in.
Close to the center, safety; toward the edges, danger.
But I have a nightmare to tell:   I am trying to say
that to be with my people is my dearest wish
but that I also love strangers
that I crave separateness
I hear myself stuttering these words
to my worst friends and my best enemies
who watch for my mistakes in grammar
my mistakes in love.
This is the day of atonement; but do my people forgive me?
If a cloud knew loneliness and fear, I would be that cloud.
 
To love the Stranger, to love solitude—am I writing merely about privilege
about drifting from the center, drawn to edges,
a privilege we can’t afford in the world that is,
who are hated as being of our kind: faggot kicked into the icy river, woman dragged from her stalled car
into the mist-struck mountains, used and hacked to death
young scholar shot at the university gates on a summer evening walk, his prizes and studies nothing, nothing availing his Blackness
Jew deluded that she’s escaped the tribe, the laws of her exclusion, the men too holy to touch her hand;   Jew who has turned her back
on midrash and mitzvah (yet wears the chai on a thong between her breasts) hiking alone
found with a swastika carved in her back at the foot of the cliffs (did she die as queer or as Jew?)
 
Solitude, O taboo, endangered species
on the mist-struck spur of the mountain, I want a gun to defend you
In the desert, on the deserted street, I want what I can’t have:
your elder sister, Justice, her great peasant’s hand outspread
her eye, half-hooded, sharp and true 
 
And I ask myself, have I thrown courage away?
have I traded off something I don’t name?
To what extreme will I go to meet the extremist?
What will I do to defend my want or anyone’s want to search for her spirit-vision
far from the protection of those she has called her own?
Will I find O solitude
your plumes, your breasts, your hair
against my face, as in childhood, your voice like the mockingbird’s
singing Yes, you are loved, why else this song?
in the old places, anywhere?
 
What is a Jew in solitude?
What is a woman in solitude, a queer woman or man?
When the winter flood-tides wrench the tower from the rock, crumble the prophet’s headland, and the farms slide into the sea
when leviathan is endangered and Jonah becomes revenger
when center and edges are crushed together, the extremities crushed together on which the world was founded
when our souls crash together, Arab and Jew, howling our loneliness within the tribes
when the refugee child and the exile’s child re-open the blasted and forbidden city
when we who refuse to be women and men as women and men are chartered, tell our stories of solitude spent in multitude
in that world as it may be, newborn and haunted, what will solitude mean?

To Robert Hass and in Memory of Elliot Gilbert



Slow dulcimer, gavotte and bow, in autumn,   
Bashō and his friends go out to view the moon;   
In summer, gasoline rainbow in the gutter,
The secret courtesy that courses like ichor   
Through the old form of the rude, full-scale joke,   
Impossible to tell in writing. “Bashō”
He named himself, “Banana Tree”: banana   
After the plant some grateful students gave him,   
Maybe in appreciation of his guidance
Threading a long night through the rules and channels   
Of their collaborative linking-poem   
Scored in their teacher’s heart: live, rigid, fluid
Like passages etched in a microscopic circuit.   
Elliot had in his memory so many jokes
They seemed to breed like microbes in a culture
Inside his brain, one so much making another   
It was impossible to tell them all:   
In the court-culture of jokes, a top banana.
Imagine a court of one: the queen a young mother,   
Unhappy, alone all day with her firstborn child   
And her new baby in a squalid apartment
Of too few rooms, a different race from her neighbors.   
She tells the child she’s going to kill herself.   
She broods, she rages. Hoping to distract her,
The child cuts capers, he sings, he does imitations   
Of different people in the building, he jokes,   
He feels if he keeps her alive until the father   
Gets home from work, they’ll be okay till morning.   
It’s laughter versus the bedroom and the pills.   
What is he in his efforts but a courtier?
Impossible to tell his whole delusion.
In the first months when I had moved back East   
From California and had to leave a message
On Bob’s machine, I used to make a habit
Of telling the tape a joke; and part-way through,   
I would pretend that I forgot the punchline,
Or make believe that I was interrupted—
As though he’d be so eager to hear the end   
He‘d have to call me back. The joke was Elliot’s,
More often than not. The doctors made the blunder   
That killed him some time later that same year.   
One day when I got home I found a message
On my machine from Bob. He had a story   
About two rabbis, one of them tall, one short,   
One day while walking along the street together
They see the corpse of a Chinese man before them,   
And Bob said, sorry, he forgot the rest.   
Of course he thought that his joke was a dummy,
Impossible to tell—a dead-end challenge.   
But here it is, as Elliot told it to me:
The dead man’s widow came to the rabbis weeping,
Begging them, if they could, to resurrect him.   
Shocked, the tall rabbi said absolutely not.   
But the short rabbi told her to bring the body
Into the study house, and ordered the shutters   
Closed so the room was night-dark. Then he prayed   
Over the body, chanting a secret blessing
Out of Kabala. “Arise and breathe,” he shouted;   
But nothing happened. The body lay still. So then   
The little rabbi called for hundreds of candles
And danced around the body, chanting and praying   
In Hebrew, then Yiddish, then Aramaic. He prayed   
In Turkish and Egyptian and Old Galician
For nearly three hours, leaping about the coffin   
In the candlelight so that his tiny black shoes   
Seemed not to touch the floor. With one last prayer
Sobbed in the Spanish of before the Inquisition
He stopped, exhausted, and looked in the dead man’s face.   
Panting, he raised both arms in a mystic gesture
And said, “Arise and breathe!” And still the body
Lay as before. Impossible to tell
In words how Elliot’s eyebrows flailed and snorted
Like shaggy mammoths as—the Chinese widow   
Granting permission—the little rabbi sang   
The blessing for performing a circumcision
And removed the dead man’s foreskin, chanting blessings   
In Finnish and Swahili, and bathed the corpse   
From head to foot, and with a final prayer
In Babylonian, gasping with exhaustion,
He seized the dead man’s head and kissed the lips   
And dropped it again and leaping back commanded,
“Arise and breathe!” The corpse lay still as ever.   
At this, as when Bashō’s disciples wind   
Along the curving spine that links the renga
Across the different voices, each one adding   
A transformation according to the rules   
Of stasis and repetition, all in order
And yet impossible to tell beforehand,   
Elliot changes for the punchline: the wee   
Rabbi, still panting, like a startled boxer,
Looks at the dead one, then up at all those watching,   
A kind of Mel Brooks gesture: “Hoo boy!” he says,   
“Now that’s what I call really dead.” O mortal
Powers and princes of earth, and you immortal   
Lords of the underground and afterlife,   
Jehovah, Raa, Bol-Morah, Hecate, Pluto,
What has a brilliant, living soul to do with   
Your harps and fires and boats, your bric-a-brac   
And troughs of smoking blood? Provincial stinkers,
Our languages don’t touch you, you’re like that mother   
Whose small child entertained her to beg her life.   
Possibly he grew up to be the tall rabbi,
The one who washed his hands of all those capers   
Right at the outset. Or maybe he became   
The author of these lines, a one-man renga
The one for whom it seems to be impossible   
To tell a story straight. It was a routine   
Procedure. When it was finished the physicians
Told Sandra and the kids it had succeeded,
But Elliot wouldn’t wake up for maybe an hour,   
They should go eat. The two of them loved to bicker
In a way that on his side went back to Yiddish,   
On Sandra’s to some Sicilian dialect.   
He used to scold her endlessly for smoking.
When she got back from dinner with their children   
The doctors had to tell them about the mistake.   
Oh swirling petals, falling leaves! The movement
Of linking renga coursing from moment to moment   
Is meaning, Bob says in his Haiku book.   
Oh swirling petals, all living things are contingent,Falling leaves, and transient, and they suffer.   
But the Universal is the goal of jokes,   
Especially certain ethnic jokes, which taper
Down through the swirling funnel of tongues and gestures   
Toward their preposterous Ithaca. There’s one   
A journalist told me. He heard it while a hero
Of the South African freedom movement was speaking   
To elderly Jews. The speaker’s own right arm   
Had been blown off by right-wing letter-bombers.
He told his listeners they had to cast their ballots   
For the ANC—a group the old Jews feared   
As “in with the Arabs.” But they started weeping
As the old one-armed fighter told them their country   
Needed them to vote for what was right, their vote   
Could make a country their children could return to
From London and Chicago. The moved old people   
Applauded wildly, and the speaker’s friend   
Whispered to the journalist, “It’s the Belgian Army
Joke come to life.” I wish that I could tell it   
To Elliot. In the Belgian Army, the feud
Between the Flemings and Walloons grew vicious,
So out of hand the army could barely function.   
Finally one commander assembled his men   
In one great room, to deal with things directly.
They stood before him at attention. “All Flemings,”   
He ordered, “to the left wall.” Half the men
Clustered to the left. “Now all Walloons,” he ordered,
“Move to the right.” An equal number crowded   
Against the right wall. Only one man remained
At attention in the middle: “What are you, soldier?”
Saluting, the man said, “Sir, I am a Belgian.”
“Why, that’s astonishing, Corporal—what’s your name?”   
Saluting again, “Rabinowitz,” he answered:
A joke that seems at first to be a story   
About the Jews. But as the renga describes   
Religious meaning by moving in drifting petals
And brittle leaves that touch and die and suffer   
The changing winds that riffle the gutter swirl,   
So in the joke, just under the raucous music
Of Fleming, Jew, Walloon, a courtly allegiance   
Moves to the dulcimer, gavotte and bow,   
Over the banana tree the moon in autumn—
Allegiance to a state impossible to tell.

I am looking at a smallpox vaccination scar
In a war movie on the arm
Of a young actor. He has just swum
Across a river somewhere in Normandy
Into the waiting arms of his rejoicing comrades.
Of course, the river’s in California,
And the actor is dead now. Nevertheless,
This is the first of many hotels this trip,
And I find myself preferring wars
To smut on the networks,
Even as I find myself readingThe Pisan Cantos for the umpteenth time
Instead of the novel in my bag.
The poet helps me to the question:
Does anything remain of home at home?
Next day is no way of knowing,
And the day after is my favorite,
A small museum really perfect
And a good meal in the middle of it.
As I’m leaving,
I notice a donkey on a vase
Biting the arm of a young girl,
And outside on the steps
A silver fish head glistens beside a bottlecap.
Plenty remains.
The work of poetry is trust,
And under the aegis of trust
Nothing could be more effortless.
Hotels show movies.
Walking around even tired
I find my eyes find
Numberless good things
And my ears hear plenty of words
Offered for nothing over the traffic noise
As sharp as sparrows.
A day and a day, more rivers crossing me.
It really feels that way, I mean
I have changed places with geography,
And rivers and towns pass over me,
Showing their scars, finding their friends.
I like it best when poetry
Gleams or shows its teeth to a girl
Forever at just the right moment.
I think I could turn and live underneath the animals.
I could be a bottlecap.
Going to the airport going home,
I stop with my teacher, now my friend.
He buys me a good breakfast, berries and hotcakes.
We finish and, standing, I hear
One policeman saying to another
Over the newspaper in a yellow booth
""Do you know this word regret, Eddie?
What does it mean?""
Plenty of words over the traffic noise,
And nothing could be more effortless.
Catching a glimpse of eternity, even a poor one, says it all.

All poetry is conceptual                                                      but some is more                                                                              conceptual                        than     others.

Last week’s weather is worth a pound of salt, just                                   like the lot of  wives or the snowy pillars of  Danton.                            There’s not a crowd in the sky. Familiarity breeds                   content. Yesterday’s                                               weather is as            beyond reach as tomorrow’s                                                                                                  dreams.

Call now.As dry as a bubble, as expectant as the dead                             of night. Without product placement, poetry                              as we know it                                                                              cannot sur- vive.                       Poetry should not be in the service of art any more than religion, ideology,                        or morality. Poetry should be in the service of nothing — and not even                        that.                        If  you can identify someone as gnostic they are probably                     notgnostic enough,                                                      for my money.            I believe in my disbelief, have faith in my reason.                       The sacred in a poem is nowhere seen and everywhere                       felt. There’s                more to transgression than                                                                           ritual, but not enoughmore. There is more               to liturgy than doctrine,       once in a blue                                                                m-                                                                                     oo-                    n.I left my purpose in my other pants.       You’re not the only paddle in the ocean, shadow in the dark, line in        the poem, lobster in the trap, pot on the stove, wheel on the truck,        letter on the keypad, scythe in the field, lever on the controls, cloud        in the sky, fruit in the tree, rat in the lab.                 Reality is usually a poor copy of the imitation. The original            is an echo of what is yet to be.                                  Time is neither linear nor circular; it is excremental.       Beauty is the memory of the loss of time.                                    Memory                                     is                                     the                                     reflection                                     of                                     the                                     loss                                     of                                     beauty.               American poetry suffers from its lack of     uncreativity. I have no faith in faith, or hope                                  for hope, no belief  in belief, no doubt of doubt.                                                         They say God is in the details. That’s                                                   because the Devil has the rest                                   covered.God is weak and imaginary — a flickering possibility. The dogma of an omniscient and omnipotent God maligns hope and denies the sacred, as it turns its back on the world.        God has no doctrine, no morality, no responsibility. To sin against    God is to use that name to justify any action or prohibition, whether    murder or martyrdom.I’ve got authenticity, you’ve got dogma  ...    proclaimeth the Lord.

It’s                                               the field of my consciousness.

Your best pleasure, Who is that dumpy matron, decked out in worn &
        faded
Shabby army fatigues which pooch out both before & behind, now
        screeching
Scoring me painfully in philistine Commedia dell’arte farce, low
        summer fare
Across a pedestrian Ferry’s stretch of water in some meshugganah Snug
        Harbor
And once more, even, fiercely pecking at me in the cold drab Parish
        Hall of
Manhattan’s Landmark Episcopal Church, where a once Avant-garde
        now Grade School
Poetry Project continues to dwell, St. Mark’s Church-in-the-Bouwerie,
        whose
Stones hold in tight grip one wooden leg & all of Peter Stuyvesant’s
        bones?Who is that midget-witch who preens & prances as she flaunts her lost
        wares,
Otherwise hidden beneath some ancient boy’s flannel-shirt, its tail out
& flapping, & who
Is shrieking even now these mean words:
                                                            “Hey     Ted!”     “Hey, you Fat God!”
& called me, “Fickle!”         “Fickle!”
                                                                 & she points a long boney finger
at me, & croons, gleefully.
                                                        “Limbo!”     “That's where you really live!”
& She is claiming to be you
 
                                                as she whispers, viciously,

In Pain, In Limbo, is where you live     in your little cloud-9 home     Ted!
Pitiful!”
               She has a small purse, & removing it from one of her
        shopping bags
She brings out from inside that small purse, my withered heart; &
lifting it
high into the air over her head with her two hands, she turns it upside
        down
unzips its fasteners, & shakes it out over the plywood floor, happily.
        “Empty,”
she cries loudly, “just like I always knew it would be!” “Empty!”
        “Empty” “Empty” 
I watch her, and think,
                                     That’s not really you, up there, is it,
                Rose?     Rochelle?     Shelley?

Your ribbon I wear, your favor tied to the grip of my lance, when I
        ride out to give battle,

                                 i         The World without Imagination
Nota: man is the intelligence of his soil,
The sovereign ghost. As such, the Socrates
Of snails, musician of pears, principium
And lex. Sed quaeritur: is this same wig
Of things, this nincompated pedagogue,
Preceptor to the sea? Crispin at sea
Created, in his day, a touch of doubt.
An eye most apt in gelatines and jupes,
Berries of villages, a barber's eye,
An eye of land, of simple salad-beds,
Of honest quilts, the eye of Crispin, hung
On porpoises, instead of apricots,
And on silentious porpoises, whose snouts
Dibbled in waves that were mustachios,
Inscrutable hair in an inscrutable world.
One eats one paté, even of salt, quotha.
It was not so much the lost terrestrial,
The snug hibernal from that sea and salt,
That century of wind in a single puff.
What counted was mythology of self,
Blotched out beyond unblotching. Crispin,
The lutanist of fleas, the knave, the thane,
The ribboned stick, the bellowing breeches, cloak
Of China, cap of Spain, imperative haw
Of hum, inquisitorial botanist,
And general lexicographer of mute
And maidenly greenhorns, now beheld himself,
A skinny sailor peering in the sea-glass.
What word split up in clickering syllables
And storming under multitudinous tones
Was name for this short-shanks in all that brunt?
Crispin was washed away by magnitude.
The whole of life that still remained in him
Dwindled to one sound strumming in his ear,
Ubiquitous concussion, slap and sigh,
Polyphony beyond his baton's thrust.
Could Crispin stem verboseness in the sea,
The old age of a watery realist,
Triton, dissolved in shifting diaphanes
Of blue and green? A wordy, watery age
That whispered to the sun's compassion, made
A convocation, nightly, of the sea-stars,
And on the cropping foot-ways of the moon
Lay grovelling. Triton incomplicate with that
Which made him Triton, nothing left of him,
Except in faint, memorial gesturings,
That were like arms and shoulders in the waves,
Here, something in the rise and fall of wind
That seemed hallucinating horn, and here,
A sunken voice, both of remembering
And of forgetfulness, in alternate strain.
Just so an ancient Crispin was dissolved.
The valet in the tempest was annulled.
Bordeaux to Yucatan, Havana next,
And then to Carolina. Simple jaunt.
Crispin, merest minuscule in the gates,
Dejected his manner to the turbulence.
The salt hung on his spirit like a frost,
The dead brine melted in him like a dew
Of winter, until nothing of himself
Remained, except some starker, barer self
In a starker, barer world, in which the sun
Was not the sun because it never shone
With bland complaisance on pale parasols,
Beetled, in chapels, on the chaste bouquets.
Against his pipping sounds a trumpet cried
Celestial sneering boisterously. Crispin
Became an introspective voyager.
Here was the veritable ding an sich, at last,
Crispin confronting it, a vocable thing,
But with a speech belched out of hoary darks
Noway resembling his, a visible thing,
And excepting negligible Triton, free
From the unavoidable shadow of himself
That lay elsewhere around him. Severance
Was clear. The last distortion of romance
Forsook the insatiable egotist. The sea
Severs not only lands but also selves.
Here was no help before reality.
Crispin beheld and Crispin was made new.
The imagination, here, could not evade,
In poems of plums, the strict austerity
Of one vast, subjugating, final tone.
The drenching of stale lives no more fell down.
What was this gaudy, gusty panoply?
Out of what swift destruction did it spring?
It was caparison of mind and cloud
And something given to make whole among
The ruses that were shattered by the large.
 
                                 iiConcerning the Thunderstorms of Yucatan
In Yucatan, the Maya sonneteers
Of the Caribbean amphitheatre,
In spite of hawk and falcon, green toucan
And jay, still to the night-bird made their plea,
As if raspberry tanagers in palms,
High up in orange air, were barbarous.
But Crispin was too destitute to find
In any commonplace the sought-for aid.
He was a man made vivid by the sea,
A man come out of luminous traversing,
Much trumpeted, made desperately clear,
Fresh from discoveries of tidal skies,
To whom oracular rockings gave no rest.
Into a savage color he went on.
How greatly had he grown in his demesne,
This auditor of insects! He that saw
The stride of vanishing autumn in a park
By way of decorous melancholy; he
That wrote his couplet yearly to the spring,
As dissertation of profound delight,
Stopping, on voyage, in a land of snakes,
Found his vicissitudes had much enlarged
His apprehension, made him intricate
In moody rucks, and difficult and strange
In all desires, his destitution's mark.
He was in this as other freemen are,
Sonorous nutshells rattling inwardly.
His violence was for aggrandizement
And not for stupor, such as music makes
For sleepers halfway waking. He perceived
That coolness for his heat came suddenly,
And only, in the fables that he scrawled
With his own quill, in its indigenous dew,
Of an aesthetic tough, diverse, untamed,
Incredible to prudes, the mint of dirt,
Green barbarism turning paradigm.
Crispin foresaw a curious promenade
Or, nobler, sensed an elemental fate,
And elemental potencies and pangs,
And beautiful barenesses as yet unseen,
Making the most of savagery of palms,
Of moonlight on the thick, cadaverous bloom
That yuccas breed, and of the panther's tread.
The fabulous and its intrinsic verse
Came like two spirits parlaying, adorned
In radiance from the Atlantic coign,
For Crispin and his quill to catechize.
But they came parlaying of such an earth,
So thick with sides and jagged lops of green,
So intertwined with serpent-kin encoiled
Among the purple tufts, the scarlet crowns,
Scenting the jungle in their refuges,
So streaked with yellow, blue and green and red
In beak and bud and fruity gobbet-skins,
That earth was like a jostling festival
Of seeds grown fat, too juicily opulent,
Expanding in the gold's maternal warmth.
So much for that. The affectionate emigrant found
A new reality in parrot-squawks.
Yet let that trifle pass. Now, as this odd
Discoverer walked through the harbor streets
Inspecting the cabildo, the façade
Of the cathedral, making notes, he heard
A rumbling, west of Mexico, it seemed,
Approaching like a gasconade of drums.
The white cabildo darkened, the façade,
As sullen as the sky, was swallowed up
In swift, successive shadows, dolefully.
The rumbling broadened as it fell. The wind,
Tempestuous clarion, with heavy cry,
Came bluntly thundering, more terrible
Than the revenge of music on bassoons.
Gesticulating lightning, mystical,
Made pallid flitter. Crispin, here, took flight.
An annotator has his scruples, too.
He knelt in the cathedral with the rest,
This connoisseur of elemental fate,
Aware of exquisite thought. The storm was one
Of many proclamations of the kind,
Proclaiming something harsher than he learned
From hearing signboards whimper in cold nights
Or seeing the midsummer artifice
Of heat upon his pane. This was the span
Of force, the quintessential fact, the note
Of Vulcan, that a valet seeks to own,
The thing that makes him envious in phrase.
And while the torrent on the roof still droned
He felt the Andean breath. His mind was free
And more than free, elate, intent, profound
And studious of a self possessing him,
That was not in him in the crusty town
From which he sailed. Beyond him, westward, lay
The mountainous ridges, purple balustrades,
In which the thunder, lapsing in its clap,
Let down gigantic quavers of its voice,
For Crispin to vociferate again.                                iii                 Approaching Carolina
The book of moonlight is not written yet
Nor half begun, but, when it is, leave room
For Crispin, fagot in the lunar fire,
Who, in the hubbub of his pilgrimage
Through sweating changes, never could forget
That wakefulness or meditating sleep,
In which the sulky strophes willingly
Bore up, in time, the somnolent, deep songs.
Leave room, therefore, in that unwritten book
For the legendary moonlight that once burned
In Crispin's mind above a continent.
America was always north to him,
A northern west or western north, but north,
And thereby polar, polar-purple, chilled
And lank, rising and slumping from a sea
Of hardy foam, receding flatly, spread
In endless ledges, glittering, submerged
And cold in a boreal mistiness of the moon.
The spring came there in clinking pannicles
Of half-dissolving frost, the summer came,
If ever, whisked and wet, not ripening,
Before the winter's vacancy returned.
The myrtle, if the myrtle ever bloomed,
Was like a glacial pink upon the air.
The green palmettoes in crepuscular ice
Clipped frigidly blue-black meridians,
Morose chiaroscuro, gauntly drawn.
How many poems he denied himself
In his observant progress, lesser things
Than the relentless contact he desired;
How many sea-masks he ignored; what sounds
He shut out from his tempering ear; what thoughts,
Like jades affecting the sequestered bride;
And what descants, he sent to banishment!
Perhaps the Arctic moonlight really gave
The liaison, the blissful liaison,
Between himself and his environment,
Which was, and is, chief motive, first delight,
For him, and not for him alone. It seemed
Elusive, faint, more mist than moon, perverse,
Wrong as a divagation to Peking,
To him that postulated as his theme
The vulgar, as his theme and hymn and flight,
A passionately niggling nightingale.
Moonlight was an evasion, or, if not,
A minor meeting, facile, delicate.
Thus he conceived his voyaging to be
An up and down between two elements,
A fluctuating between sun and moon,
A sally into gold and crimson forms,
As on this voyage, out of goblinry,
And then retirement like a turning back
And sinking down to the indulgences
That in the moonlight have their habitude.
But let these backward lapses, if they would,
Grind their seductions on him, Crispin knew
It was a flourishing tropic he required
For his refreshment, an abundant zone,
Prickly and obdurate, dense, harmonious
Yet with a harmony not rarefied
Nor fined for the inhibited instruments
Of over-civil stops. And thus he tossed
Between a Carolina of old time,
A little juvenile, an ancient whim,
And the visible, circumspect presentment drawn
From what he saw across his vessel's prow.
He came. The poetic hero without palms
Or jugglery, without regalia.
And as he came he saw that it was spring,
A time abhorrent to the nihilist
Or searcher for the fecund minimum.
The moonlight fiction disappeared. The spring,
Although contending featly in its veils,
Irised in dew and early fragrancies,
Was gemmy marionette to him that sought
A sinewy nakedness. A river bore
The vessel inward. Tilting up his nose,
He inhaled the rancid rosin, burly smells
Of dampened lumber, emanations blown
From warehouse doors, the gustiness of ropes,
Decays of sacks, and all the arrant stinks
That helped him round his rude aesthetic out.
He savored rankness like a sensualist.
He marked the marshy ground around the dock,
The crawling railroad spur, the rotten fence,
Curriculum for the marvellous sophomore.
It purified. It made him see how much
Of what he saw he never saw at all.
He gripped more closely the essential prose
As being, in a world so falsified,
The one integrity for him, the one
Discovery still possible to make,
To which all poems were incident, unless
That prose should wear a poem's guise at last.                             iv               The Idea of a Colony
Nota: his soil is man's intelligence.
That's better. That's worth crossing seas to find.
Crispin in one laconic phrase laid bare
His cloudy drift and planned a colony.
Exit the mental moonlight, exit lex,
Rex and principium, exit the whole
Shebang. Exeunt omnes. Here was prose
More exquisite than any tumbling verse:
A still new continent in which to dwell.
What was the purpose of his pilgrimage,
Whatever shape it took in Crispin's mind,
If not, when all is said, to drive away
The shadow of his fellows from the skies,
And, from their stale intelligence released,
To make a new intelligence prevail?
Hence the reverberations in the words
Of his first central hymns, the celebrants
Of rankest trivia, tests of the strength
Of his aesthetic, his philosophy,
The more invidious, the more desired.
The florist asking aid from cabbages,
The rich man going bare, the paladin
Afraid, the blind man as astronomer,
The appointed power unwielded from disdain.
His western voyage ended and began.
The torment of fastidious thought grew slack,
Another, still more bellicose, came on.
He, therefore, wrote his prolegomena,
And, being full of the caprice, inscribed
Commingled souvenirs and prophecies.
He made a singular collation. Thus:
The natives of the rain are rainy men.
Although they paint effulgent, azure lakes,
And April hillsides wooded white and pink,
Their azure has a cloudy edge, their white
And pink, the water bright that dogwood bears.
And in their music showering sounds intone.
On what strange froth does the gross Indian dote,
What Eden sapling gum, what honeyed gore,
What pulpy dram distilled of innocence,
That streaking gold should speak in him
Or bask within his images and words?
If these rude instances impeach themselves
By force of rudeness, let the principle
Be plain. For application Crispin strove,
Abhorring Turk as Esquimau, the lute
As the marimba, the magnolia as rose.
Upon these premises propounding, he
Projected a colony that should extend
To the dusk of a whistling south below the south.
A comprehensive island hemisphere.
The man in Georgia waking among pines
Should be pine-spokesman. The responsive man,
Planting his pristine cores in Florida,
Should prick thereof, not on the psaltery,
But on the banjo's categorical gut,
Tuck tuck, while the flamingos flapped his bays.
Sepulchral señors, bibbing pale mescal,
Oblivious to the Aztec almanacs,
Should make the intricate Sierra scan.
And dark Brazilians in their cafés,
Musing immaculate, pampean dits,
Should scrawl a vigilant anthology,
To be their latest, lucent paramour.
These are the broadest instances. Crispin,
Progenitor of such extensive scope,
Was not indifferent to smart detail.
The melon should have apposite ritual,
Performed in verd apparel, and the peach,
When its black branches came to bud, belle day,
Should have an incantation. And again,
When piled on salvers its aroma steeped
The summer, it should have a sacrament
And celebration. Shrewd novitiates
Should be the clerks of our experience.
These bland excursions into time to come,
Related in romance to backward flights,
However prodigal, however proud,
Contained in their afflatus the reproach
That first drove Crispin to his wandering.
He could not be content with counterfeit,
With masquerade of thought, with hapless words
That must belie the racking masquerade,
With fictive flourishes that preordained
His passion's permit, hang of coat, degree
Of buttons, measure of his salt. Such trash
Might help the blind, not him, serenely sly.
It irked beyond his patience. Hence it was,
Preferring text to gloss, he humbly served
Grotesque apprenticeship to chance event,
A clown, perhaps, but an aspiring clown.
There is a monotonous babbling in our dreams
That makes them our dependent heirs, the heirs
Of dreamers buried in our sleep, and not
The oncoming fantasies of better birth.
The apprentice knew these dreamers. If he dreamed
Their dreams, he did it in a gingerly way.
All dreams are vexing. Let them be expunged.
But let the rabbit run, the cock declaim.
Trinket pasticcio, flaunting skyey sheets,
With Crispin as the tiptoe cozener?
No, no: veracious page on page, exact.                                v                 A Nice Shady Home
Crispin as hermit, pure and capable,
Dwelt in the land. Perhaps if discontent
Had kept him still the pricking realist,
Choosing his element from droll confect
Of was and is and shall or ought to be,
Beyond Bordeaux, beyond Havana, far
Beyond carked Yucatan, he might have come
To colonize his polar planterdom
And jig his chits upon a cloudy knee.
But his emprize to that idea soon sped.
Crispin dwelt in the land and dwelling there
Slid from his continent by slow recess
To things within his actual eye, alert
To the difficulty of rebellious thought
When the sky is blue. The blue infected will.
It may be that the yarrow in his fields
Sealed pensive purple under its concern.
But day by day, now this thing and now that
Confined him, while it cosseted, condoned,
Little by little, as if the suzerain soil
Abashed him by carouse to humble yet
Attach. It seemed haphazard denouement.
He first, as realist, admitted that
Whoever hunts a matinal continent
May, after all, stop short before a plum
And be content and still be realist.
The words of things entangle and confuse.
The plum survives its poems. It may hang
In the sunshine placidly, colored by ground
Obliquities of those who pass beneath,
Harlequined and mazily dewed and mauved
In bloom. Yet it survives in its own form,
Beyond these changes, good, fat, guzzly fruit.
So Crispin hasped on the surviving form,
For him, of shall or ought to be in is.
Was he to bray this in profoundest brass
Arointing his dreams with fugal requiems?
Was he to company vastest things defunct
With a blubber of tom-toms harrowing the sky?
Scrawl a tragedian's testament? Prolong
His active force in an inactive dirge,
Which, let the tall musicians call and call,
Should merely call him dead? Pronounce amen
Through choirs infolded to the outmost clouds?
Because he built a cabin who once planned
Loquacious columns by the ructive sea?
Because he turned to salad-beds again?
Jovial Crispin, in calamitous crape?
Should he lay by the personal and make
Of his own fate an instance of all fate?
What is one man among so many men?
What are so many men in such a world?
Can one man think one thing and think it long?
Can one man be one thing and be it long?
The very man despising honest quilts
Lies quilted to his poll in his despite.
For realists, what is is what should be.
And so it came, his cabin shuffled up,
His trees were planted, his duenna brought
Her prismy blonde and clapped her in his hands,
The curtains flittered and the door was closed.
Crispin, magister of a single room,
Latched up the night. So deep a sound fell down
It was as if the solitude concealed
And covered him and his congenial sleep.
So deep a sound fell down it grew to be
A long soothsaying silence down and down.
The crickets beat their tambours in the wind,
Marching a motionless march, custodians.
In the presto of the morning, Crispin trod,
Each day, still curious, but in a round
Less prickly and much more condign than that
He once thought necessary. Like Candide,
Yeoman and grub, but with a fig in sight,
And cream for the fig and silver for the cream,
A blonde to tip the silver and to taste
The rapey gouts. Good star, how that to be
Annealed them in their cabin ribaldries!
Yet the quotidian saps philosophers
And men like Crispin like them in intent,
If not in will, to track the knaves of thought.
But the quotidian composed as his,
Of breakfast ribands, fruits laid in their leaves,
The tomtit and the cassia and the rose,
Although the rose was not the noble thorn
Of crinoline spread, but of a pining sweet,
Composed of evenings like cracked shutters flung
Upon the rumpling bottomness, and nights
In which those frail custodians watched,
Indifferent to the tepid summer cold,
While he poured out upon the lips of her
That lay beside him, the quotidian
Like this, saps like the sun, true fortuner.
For all it takes it gives a humped return
Exchequering from piebald fiscs unkeyed.                               vi           And Daughters with Curls
Portentous enunciation, syllable
To blessed syllable affined, and sound
Bubbling felicity in cantilene,
Prolific and tormenting tenderness
Of music, as it comes to unison,
Forgather and bell boldly Crispin's last
Deduction. Thrum, with a proud douceur
His grand pronunciamento and devise.
The chits came for his jigging, bluet-eyed,
Hands without touch yet touching poignantly,
Leaving no room upon his cloudy knee,
Prophetic joint, for its diviner young.
The return to social nature, once begun,
Anabasis or slump, ascent or chute,
Involved him in midwifery so dense
His cabin counted as phylactery,
Then place of vexing palankeens, then haunt
Of children nibbling at the sugared void,
Infants yet eminently old, then dome
And halidom for the unbraided femes,
Green crammers of the green fruits of the world,
Bidders and biders for its ecstasies,
True daughters both of Crispin and his clay.
All this with many mulctings of the man,
Effective colonizer sharply stopped
In the door-yard by his own capacious bloom.
But that this bloom grown riper, showing nibs
Of its eventual roundness, puerile tints
Of spiced and weathery rouges, should complex
The stopper to indulgent fatalist
Was unforeseen. First Crispin smiled upon
His goldenest demoiselle, inhabitant,
She seemed, of a country of the capuchins,
So delicately blushed, so humbly eyed,
Attentive to a coronal of things
Secret and singular. Second, upon
A second similar counterpart, a maid
Most sisterly to the first, not yet awake
Excepting to the motherly footstep, but
Marvelling sometimes at the shaken sleep.
Then third, a thing still flaxen in the light,
A creeper under jaunty leaves. And fourth,
Mere blusteriness that gewgaws jollified,
All din and gobble, blasphemously pink.
A few years more and the vermeil capuchin
Gave to the cabin, lordlier than it was,
The dulcet omen fit for such a house.
The second sister dallying was shy
To fetch the one full-pinioned one himself
Out of her botches, hot embosomer.
The third one gaping at the orioles
Lettered herself demurely as became
A pearly poetess, peaked for rhapsody.
The fourth, pent now, a digit curious.
Four daughters in a world too intricate
In the beginning, four blithe instruments
Of differing struts, four voices several
In couch, four more personæ, intimate
As buffo, yet divers, four mirrors blue
That should be silver, four accustomed seeds
Hinting incredible hues, four self-same lights
That spread chromatics in hilarious dark,
Four questioners and four sure answerers.
Crispin concocted doctrine from the rout.
The world, a turnip once so readily plucked,
Sacked up and carried overseas, daubed out
Of its ancient purple, pruned to the fertile main,
And sown again by the stiffest realist,
Came reproduced in purple, family font,
The same insoluble lump. The fatalist
Stepped in and dropped the chuckling down his craw,
Without grace or grumble. Score this anecdote

In form though in design, as Crispin willed,

Autumn's compendium, strident in itself
But muted, mused, and perfectly revolved
In those portentous accents, syllables,
And sounds of music coming to accord
Upon his law, like their inherent sphere,
Seraphic proclamations of the pure
Delivered with a deluging onwardness.
Or if the music sticks, if the anecdote
Is false, if Crispin is a profitless
Philosopher, beginning with green brag,
Concluding fadedly, if as a man
Prone to distemper he abates in taste,
Fickle and fumbling, variable, obscure,
Glozing his life with after-shining flicks,
Illuminating, from a fancy gorged
By apparition, plain and common things,
Sequestering the fluster from the year,
Making gulped potions from obstreperous drops,
And so distorting, proving what he proves
Is nothing, what can all this matter since
The relation comes, benignly, to its end?
So may the relation of each man be clipped.

My pensive Sara! thy soft cheek reclined Thus on mine arm, most soothing sweet it is To sit beside our Cot, our Cot o’ergrown With white-flowered Jasmin, and the broad-leaved Myrtle, (Meet emblems they of Innocence and Love!) And watch the clouds, that late were rich with light, Slow saddening round, and mark the star of eve Serenely brilliant (such would Wisdom be) Shine opposite! How exquisite the scents Snatched from yon bean-field! and the world so hushed! The stilly murmur of the distant Sea Tells us of silence.                             And that simplest Lute, Placed length-ways in the clasping casement, hark! How by the desultory breeze caressed, Like some coy maid half yielding to her lover, It pours such sweet upbraiding, as must needs Tempt to repeat the wrong! And now, its strings Boldlier swept, the long sequacious notes Over delicious surges sink and rise, Such a soft floating witchery of sound As twilight Elfins make, when they at eve Voyage on gentle gales from Fairy-Land, Where Melodies round honey-dropping flowers, Footless and wild, like birds of Paradise, Nor pause, nor perch, hovering on untamed wing! O! the one Life within us and abroad, Which meets all motion and becomes its soul, A light in sound, a sound-like power in light, Rhythm in all thought, and joyance everywhere— Methinks, it should have been impossible Not to love all things in a world so filled; Where the breeze warbles, and the mute still air Is Music slumbering on her instrument.     And thus, my Love! as on the midway slope Of yonder hill I stretch my limbs at noon, Whilst through my half-closed eyelids I behold The sunbeams dance, like diamonds, on the main, And tranquil muse upon tranquility: Full many a thought uncalled and undetained, And many idle flitting phantasies, Traverse my indolent and passive brain, As wild and various as the random gales That swell and flutter on this subject Lute!     And what if all of animated nature Be but organic Harps diversely framed, That tremble into thought, as o’er them sweeps Plastic and vast, one intellectual breeze, At once the Soul of each, and God of all?     But thy more serious eye a mild reproof Darts, O beloved Woman! nor such thoughts Dim and unhallowed dost thou not reject, And biddest me walk humbly with my God. Meek Daughter in the family of Christ! Well hast thou said and holily dispraised These shapings of the unregenerate mind; Bubbles that glitter as they rise and break On vain Philosophy’s aye-babbling spring. For never guiltless may I speak of him, The Incomprehensible! save when with awe I praise him, and with Faith that inly feels; Who with his saving mercies healèd me, A sinful and most miserable man, Wildered and dark, and gave me to possess Peace, and this Cot, and thee, heart-honored Maid!

To draw no envy, Shakespeare, on thy name, Am I thus ample to thy book and fame; While I confess thy writings to be such As neither man nor muse can praise too much; 'Tis true, and all men's suffrage. But these ways Were not the paths I meant unto thy praise; For seeliest ignorance on these may light, Which, when it sounds at best, but echoes right; Or blind affection, which doth ne'er advance The truth, but gropes, and urgeth all by chance; Or crafty malice might pretend this praise, And think to ruin, where it seem'd to raise. These are, as some infamous bawd or whore Should praise a matron; what could hurt her more? But thou art proof against them, and indeed, Above th' ill fortune of them, or the need. I therefore will begin. Soul of the age! The applause, delight, the wonder of our stage! My Shakespeare, rise! I will not lodge thee by Chaucer, or Spenser, or bid Beaumont lie A little further, to make thee a room: Thou art a monument without a tomb, And art alive still while thy book doth live And we have wits to read and praise to give. That I not mix thee so, my brain excuses, I mean with great, but disproportion'd Muses, For if I thought my judgment were of years, I should commit thee surely with thy peers, And tell how far thou didst our Lyly outshine, Or sporting Kyd, or Marlowe's mighty line. And though thou hadst small Latin and less Greek, From thence to honour thee, I would not seek For names; but call forth thund'ring Aeschylus, Euripides and Sophocles to us; Pacuvius, Accius, him of Cordova dead, To life again, to hear thy buskin tread, And shake a stage; or, when thy socks were on, Leave thee alone for the comparison Of all that insolent Greece or haughty Rome Sent forth, or since did from their ashes come. Tri'umph, my Britain, thou hast one to show To whom all scenes of Europe homage owe. He was not of an age but for all time! And all the Muses still were in their prime, When, like Apollo, he came forth to warm Our ears, or like a Mercury to charm! Nature herself was proud of his designs And joy'd to wear the dressing of his lines, Which were so richly spun, and woven so fit, As, since, she will vouchsafe no other wit. The merry Greek, tart Aristophanes, Neat Terence, witty Plautus, now not please, But antiquated and deserted lie, As they were not of Nature's family. Yet must I not give Nature all: thy art, My gentle Shakespeare, must enjoy a part. For though the poet's matter nature be, His art doth give the fashion; and, that he Who casts to write a living line, must sweat, (Such as thine are) and strike the second heat Upon the Muses' anvil; turn the same (And himself with it) that he thinks to frame, Or, for the laurel, he may gain a scorn; For a good poet's made, as well as born; And such wert thou. Look how the father's face Lives in his issue, even so the race Of Shakespeare's mind and manners brightly shines In his well-turned, and true-filed lines; In each of which he seems to shake a lance, As brandish'd at the eyes of ignorance. Sweet Swan of Avon! what a sight it were To see thee in our waters yet appear, And make those flights upon the banks of Thames, That so did take Eliza and our James! But stay, I see thee in the hemisphere Advanc'd, and made a constellation there! Shine forth, thou star of poets, and with rage Or influence, chide or cheer the drooping stage; Which, since thy flight from hence, hath mourn'd like night, And despairs day, but for thy volume's light.

Elizabeth Bishop leaned on a table, it cracked, both fell to the floor. A gesture gone sadly awry. This was close to fact and quickly became symbolic, bound to occur in Florida, where she was surrounded by rotting abundance and greedy insects. One moment a laughing smile, a graceful hand alighting on solid furniture, a casual shift of weight, the next, undignified splayed legs. The shell of the table proved to be stuffed with termite eggs. True, it was a fall from no great height—merely the height of herself, and although the hollowed-out table failed, at least the floor held, though probably infested by termites as well, and possibly built on a latent sinkhole, how can you tell? And how could she, smiling and easy, arm moving without forethought and permission, have forgotten fear, apparently let go of a hard-learned lesson? Enter a room as though it is strange.

The poem in which we drive an hour to the beach and Uncle Dave doesn't get out

The poem in which we left the yellow plastic shovel behind and everyone is bereft.
The poem in which I can't stop talking about how you walked deep into Lake Erie
         and the water was still only up to your knees when you turned into a speck
         past the rock jetty.
The poem in which everyone listens to celebrity gossip in the car on the way back.
The poem in which I pontificate on how ugly the fiancée of that Jonas brother is,
         and how they're too young to get married, and how my grandmother's old
         neighbor would have said, ""Ugly? She can't help that she's ugly. It's that she's
         so stupid,"" and I would have yelled at her for assuming that all former hair-
         dressers are dim.
The poem in which I turn into my grandmother's old neighbor.
The poem in which I remember very clearly how they both stored tissues in their
          bras.
The poem in which I think about how this would horrify your mother—the
          pendulous breasts, the moist tissues, the dipping into the cleavage to retrieve
          anything.
The poem in which your mother tries not to wince when I order whatever I want
          from the menu despite her coupon for two medium 1-topping pizzas.
The poem in which I try to find a deeper meaning for why I notice the woman
          ahead of us in line at Johnny's Liquor Store who buys a pack of menthols and        
          asks the guy behind the counter if he knows her good-for-nothing brother. She
          has hair that looks like cats got at a skein of yarn, and a tattoo above her ankle
          that's dark and unspecified. It's far enough above her ankle that it's nearly mid-
          calf—like her ankle and calf are two different countries and the tattoo got lost
          in the borderlands on the way to its actual destination.
The poem in which I am territory that is under dispute and no one will occupy it
          because of fear and uncertainty.
The poem in which I reach the conclusion that this feeling is inspired by your
          mother and the way she hums out-of-season carols while doing kitchen tasks,
          though it's not really about the humming but rather the time she asked me to
          light the Hanukkah candles in the attic because it would be better if they were
          out of the way for the Christmas party.
The poem in which you and I are in line waiting to buy a mixed six-pack of Great
          Lakes and I am staring at a stranger's tattoo and thinking about the fact that I
          am not Anne Frank while the baby is in the car with your mother.
The poem in which I go into Walmart and buy the baby an olive-green cap that
          looks suspiciously like Fidel Castro's.
The poem in which I could eradicate the fact that I ever went into Walmart and
          bought anything so the baby can one day start a revolution.
The poem in which we see a couple on the highway median in a stalled-out Buick
          and don't stop to help.
The poem in which the highway median looks like the spit of land between two
          enemy trenches and I feel a deep longing for my childhood.
The poem in which I remember, for no apparent reason, the tornado instructions
          taped to the sides of all the filing cabinets in one office I worked in that was on
          the top floor of a mostly abandoned mall in Overland Park, Kansas. All that
          was left: decorative fountains, floor tiles, mirrored ceilings, Nearly Famous
          Pizza, the carcass of Sears.
The poem in which we leave Northeastern Ohio, The poem in which we return to
          Northeastern Ohio.
The poem in which it is night and we are lost in Northeastern Ohio and we keep
          passing Amish buggies adorned with reflective tape.
The poem in which the moon is a vehicle for content, and is far less than a perfect
          reflector of anything.
The poem in which we are all in some kind of limbo.

Oh this Diet Coke is really good,though come to think of it it tasteslike nothing plus the idea of chocolate,or an acquaintance of chocolatespeaking fondly of certain timesit and chocolate had spoken of nothing,or nothing remembering a fieldin which it once ate the most wondroussandwich of ham and rustic chambered cheeseyet still wished for a piece of chocolatebefore the lone walk back throughthe corn then the darkening forestto the disappointing village and its supercreepy bed and breakfast. With secret despairI returned to the city. Something seemed to be waiting for me. Maybe the “chosen guide” Wordsworth wrote he would even were it “nothing better than a wandering cloud”have followed which of course to meand everyone sounds amazing.All I follow is my own desire, sometimes to feel, sometimes to beat least a little more than intermittentlyat ease with being loved. I am neverat ease. Not with hours I can read or walkand look at the brightly coloredhouses filled with lives, not with nightwhen I lie on my back and listen,not with the hallway, definitely not with baseball, definitely not with time. Poor Coleridge, sonof a Vicar and a lake, he could not feelthe energy. No present joy, no cheerfulconfidence, just love of friends and the windtaking his arrow away.

We are both strong, dark, bright men,
though perhaps you might not notice,
finding two figures flat against the landscape
like the shadowed backs of mountains.
Which would not be far from wrong,
for though we both have on Western clothes
and he is seated on a yellow spool
of emptied and forgotten telephone cable
and I recline on a green aluminum lounge,
we are both facing into the August sun
as august as Hiroshima and the autumn.
There are differences, however, if you care
to discover, coming close, respectfully.
You must discover the landscape as you go.
Come. It is in the eyes, the face, the way
we would greet you stumbling as you arrive.
He is much the smooth, grass-brown slopes
reaching knee-high around you as you walk;
I am the cracks of cliffs and gullies,
pieces of secret deep in the back of the eye.
But he is still my father, and I his son.
After a while, there is time to go fishing,
both of us squatting on rocks in the dusk,
leaving peaks and tree line responsible for light.
There is a lake below, which both of us
acknowledge, by facing, forward, like the sun.
Ripples of fish, moon, luminous insects.
Frogs, owls, crickets at their sound.
Deer, raccoon, badger come down to drink.
At the water's edge, the children are fishing,
casting shadows from the enormous shoreline.
Everything functions in the function of summer.
And gradually, and not by chance, the action
stops, the children hush back among rocks
and also watch, with nothing to capture but dusk.
There are four of us, together among others.
And I am not at all certain what all this means,
if it means anything, but feel with all my being
that I must write this down, if I write anything.
My father, his son, his grandsons, strong, serene.
Night, night, night, before the following morning.

There are stones even here
worn into a malevolence by time
gritting the teeth and tearing
the eyes with the memory.
Out in the desert, the wind
is a sculptor working the ephemera
of sand. Desperately editing steles
to write the names of thousands of slaves
who died to make Pharaoh great.
It is a fool’s game.
And we are like the blind musician
at the hotel who tells us with a smile:
I’ll see you later.
The guard at the pyramid eyes me.
Are you Egyptian? he demands,
then searches my bag for a bomb.
At the hotel they speak Arabic to me,
don’t treat me like the white guests,
and I guess, even here, with all
the hindsight of history we haven’t
learned to love ourselves.
I cannot crawl into the tombs, and cannot
explain why. How do you say: In my country
they buried me alive for six months?
And so you lie and tell yourself this is love.
I am protecting the world from my rage.
Rabab tells me: We know how to build graves
here. I nod. I know. It is the same all over Africa.
Do you have a knife? Do you have one?
the guards at the museum ask Breyten and me,
searching us. We call this on ourselves. We
are clearly political criminals.
I trace the glyphs chipped into stone.
As a writer I am drawn to this. If I could
I too would carve myself into eternity.
Breyten watching me says: Don’t tell me
you’ve found a spelling mistake in it!
A line of miniature statues is placed
into the tomb to serve the pharaoh.
One for each day of the year. Four hundred.
The overseers are a plus. I think
even death will not ease
the lot of the poor here.
Statues: it seems the more I search the world
for differences the more I find it all the same.
Perhaps the Buddha was a jaded traveler too
when he said we are all one.
Mona argues about who should pay
to see the mummies. It isn’t often I can
treat a girl to a dead body, Breyten insists.
A woman nearby tells her husand she can see
dead bodies at work. Why pay?
Do you think she works in a hospital? I ask.
That or the U.S. State Department, Breyten agrees.
From the top of Bab Zwelia, flat rooftops
spread out like a conference of coffee tables.
Broken walls, furniture, pots, litter the roofs
like family secrets sunning themselves.
Two white goats on a roof chew
their way through the debris.
On the Nile, Rabab sings in Arabic, tells me
she wants to be Celine Dion.
She is my sister calling me home to Egypt.
Perhaps one day I will be ready.
For now it is enough to know I can
be at home here.

Because in medieval Italian it meant “room” I tied the curtains at their elbows with what could have been honor cords or worse yet, a belt from the 60s, so hideous were the tassels that were dancing a little tarantella after I had propped the windows and the wind had carried in the song the rubbing trees were making, without any accompaniment, mind you, from a tambourine, although the bells of   the occasional sleigh played that part, while I waited for the vixen and their shameless yelping to follow the music and the cold and the night inside where I sat half man, half snow, to investigate my squeaking pencil and the flapping of the bird-white page I couldn’t seem to catch in those years when I lugged around a frozen heart and was infatuated with whiteness, since I had read somewhere it was the absence of color, which could not be true since I had once loved a pure white duck with a white bill and feet and I had even torn its white flesh with my teeth that were still then white, which should have been all the proof anyone needed to debunk our outdated theories of absence.

After “Exile’s Letter” by Ezra Pound



To Tom S. of Missouri, possum friend, clerk at Lloyd’s.Now I remember that you rang a silent bellBy the foot of the bridge at the River “Thames.”With dull roots and dried tubers, you wrote poems and lamentsAnd grew more English month on month, bowing to kings and princes.Americans came drifting in from the sea and from the west border,And with them, and with me especiallyEverything was pig-headed,And I made hay from poppycock and painted adjectives,Just so we could start a new fellowship,And we all escaped our personalities, without expressing them.And then I was sent off to Rapallo,                trailed by children,And you to your desk at Faber-Faber,Till we had nothing but China and silence in common.And then, when modernism had come to its worst,We wrote, and published in Po-Etry,Through all the one hundred kinds of shy and whispering silence,Into a poem of a thousand blank pages,That was the first heave;And into ten thousand poems full of Chinese reticence.And with chafing saddle and the bit in his mouthOut from the East came Confucius and his philosophy,And there came also the “True-man” Ben-it-o to awe me,Playing in the death-mask of Jefferson.In the botched houses of Europe they gave us more foetid music,Clanging instruments, like the sound of a myriad dying.My forefather Confucius got me drunk and I danced                because my savage mind wouldn’t keep stillWithout his music playing,And I, wrapped in silence, woke up with my head on his lap,And my voice returning to me from every radio,And before the end of the broadcast we scattered like cards, or bombs,I had to be off to China, so far across my desktop,You back to your London-bridge.And our Roosevelt, who was brave as a rodent,Was president in Washing Town, and let in the usurious rabble.And one May he sent the soldiers for me,                despite the long distance.And what with broken idols and so on, I won’t say it wasn’t hard going,Over roads twisted like my brain’s folds.And I was still going, late in the war,                with defeat blowing in from the North,Not guessing how little I knew of the cost,                and how soon I would be paying it.And what a reception:Steel cages, two books set on a packing-crate table,And I was caught, and had no hope of escaping.And you would walk out with me to the northeast corner of my cell,Toward the Alpine peak, with clouds about it as foul as London air,With you whispering, and with a bang, not a whimper,With glasses like dinner plates, glowing grass-green in the darkness,Pleasure-fasting, with women, coming and going without speech,With the dandruff-flakes falling like snow,And the hyacinth girls eating lunch in silence,And the sea, knee-deep, reflecting white eyebrows —Eyebrows turned white are an awful sight in the sunlight,Hideously aged —And the sea-girls singing back at us,Drowning in seaweed brocade,And the wind twisting the song, and desiccating it,Covering our eyes with dust.                And this is the way the world ends.                With a bang, not with a whimper.I went up to the court for prosecution,Tried standing mute, offered a madman’s song,And got no conviction,               and went back to Saint Elizabeths                Committed.And once again, later, you stood at the foot of my bed,And then the visit ended, you went back to Bloomsbury,And if you ask if I recall that parting:It is like the hair falling from my hieratic head,                Confused ... Whirl! Centripetal! Mate!What is the use of talking, until I end my song,I end my song in the dark.I call in the nurse,Hold the pill in my hand                As she says, “Take this,”And swallow it down, silent.

I think it better that in times like these A poet's mouth be silent, for in truth We have no gift to set a statesman right; He has had enough of meddling who can please A young girl in the indolence of her youth, Or an old man upon a winter’s night.

I Beyond the hollow sunset, ere a star Take heart in heaven from eastward, while the west, Fulfilled of watery resonance and rest, Is as a port with clouds for harbour bar To fold the fleet in of the winds from far That stir no plume now of the bland sea's breast: II Above the soft sweep of the breathless bay Southwestward, far past flight of night and day, Lower than the sunken sunset sinks, and higher Than dawn can freak the front of heaven with fire, My thought with eyes and wings made wide makes way To find the place of souls that I desire. III If any place for any soul there be, Disrobed and disentrammelled; if the might, The fire and force that filled with ardent light The souls whose shadow is half the light we see, Survive and be suppressed not of the night; This hour should show what all day hid from me. IV Night knows not, neither is it shown to day, By sunlight nor by starlight is it shown, Nor to the full moon's eye nor footfall known, Their world's untrodden and unkindled way. Nor is the breath nor music of it blown With sounds of winter or with winds of May. V But here, where light and darkness reconciled Held earth between them as a weanling child Between the balanced hands of death and birth, Even as they held the new-born shape of earth When first life trembled in her limbs and smiled, Here hope might think to find what hope were worth. VI Past Hades, past Elysium, past the long Slow smooth strong lapse of Lethe—past the toil Wherein all souls are taken as a spoil, The Stygian web of waters—if your song Be quenched not, O our brethren, but be strong As ere ye too shook off our temporal coil; VII If yet these twain survive your worldly breath, Joy trampling sorrow, life devouring death, If perfect life possess your life all through And like your words your souls be deathless too, To-night, of all whom night encompasseth, My soul would commune with one soul of you. VIII Above the sunset might I see thine eyes That were above the sundawn in our skies, Son of the songs of morning,—thine that were First lights to lighten that rekindling air Wherethrough men saw the front of England rise And heard thine loudest of the lyre-notes there— IX If yet thy fire have not one spark the less, O Titan, born of her a Titaness, Across the sunrise and the sunset's mark Send of thy lyre one sound, thy fire one spark, To change this face of our unworthiness, Across this hour dividing light from dark. X To change this face of our chill time, that hears No song like thine of all that crowd its ears, Of all its lights that lighten all day long Sees none like thy most fleet and fiery sphere's Outlightening Sirius—in its twilight throng No thunder and no sunrise like thy song. XI Hath not the sea-wind swept the sea-line bare To pave with stainless fire through stainless air A passage for thine heavenlier feet to tread Ungrieved of earthly floor-work? hath it spread No covering splendid as the sun-god's hair To veil or to reveal thy lordlier head? XII Hath not the sunset strewn across the sea A way majestical enough for thee? What hour save this should be thine hour—and mine, If thou have care of any less divine Than thine own soul; if thou take thought of me, Marlowe, as all my soul takes thought of thine? XIII Before the morn's face as before the sun The morning star and evening star are one For all men's lands as England. O, if night Hang hard upon us,—ere our day take flight, Shed thou some comfort from thy day long done On us pale children of the latter light! XIV For surely, brother and master and lord and king, Where'er thy footfall and thy face make spring In all souls' eyes that meet thee wheresoe'er, And have thy soul for sunshine and sweet air— Some late love of thine old live land should cling, Some living love of England, round thee there. XV Here from her shore across her sunniest sea My soul makes question of the sun for thee, And waves and beams make answer. When thy feet Made her ways flowerier and their flowers more sweet With childlike passage of a god to be, Like spray these waves cast off her foemen's fleet. XVI Like foam they flung it from her, and like weed Its wrecks were washed from scornful shoal to shoal, From rock to rock reverberate; and the whole Sea laughed and lightened with a deathless deed That sowed our enemies in her field for seed And made her shores fit harbourage for thy soul. XVII Then in her green south fields, a poor man's child, Thou hadst thy short sweet fill of half-blown joy, That ripens all of us for time to cloy With full-blown pain and passion; ere the wild World caught thee by the fiery heart, and smiled To make so swift end of the godlike boy. XVIII For thou, if ever godlike foot there trod These fields of ours, wert surely like a god. Who knows what splendour of strange dreams was shed With sacred shadow and glimmer of gold and red From hallowed windows, over stone and sod, On thine unbowed bright insubmissive head? XIX The shadow stayed not, but the splendour stays, Our brother, till the last of English days. No day nor night on English earth shall be For ever, spring nor summer, Junes nor Mays, But somewhat as a sound or gleam of thee Shall come on us like morning from the sea. XX Like sunrise never wholly risen, nor yet Quenched; or like sunset never wholly set, A light to lighten as from living eyes The cold unlit close lids of one that lies Dead, or a ray returned from death's far skies To fire us living lest our lives forget. XXI For in that heaven what light of lights may be, What splendour of what stars, what spheres of flame Sounding, that none may number nor may name, We know not, even thy brethren; yea, not we Whose eyes desire the light that lightened thee, Whose ways and thine are one way and the same. XXII But if the riddles that in sleep we read, And trust them not, be flattering truth indeed, As he that rose our mightiest called them,—he, Much higher than thou as thou much higher than we— There, might we say, all flower of all our seed, All singing souls are as one sounding sea. XXIII All those that here were of thy kind and kin, Beside thee and below thee, full of love, Full-souled for song,—and one alone above Whose only light folds all your glories in— With all birds' notes from nightingale to dove Fill the world whither we too fain would win. XXIV The world that sees in heaven the sovereign light Of sunlike Shakespeare, and the fiery night Whose stars were watched of Webster; and beneath, The twin-souled brethren of the single wreath, Grown in kings' gardens, plucked from pastoral heath, Wrought with all flowers for all men's heart's delight. XXV And that fixed fervour, iron-red like Mars, In the mid moving tide of tenderer stars, That burned on loves and deeds the darkest done, Athwart the incestuous prisoner's bride-house bars; And thine, most highest of all their fires but one, Our morning star, sole risen before the sun. XXVI And one light risen since theirs to run such race Thou hast seen, O Phosphor, from thy pride of place. Thou hast seen Shelley, him that was to thee As light to fire or dawn to lightning; me, Me likewise, O our brother, shalt thou see, And I behold thee, face to glorious face? XXVII You twain the same swift year of manhood swept Down the steep darkness, and our father wept. And from the gleam of Apollonian tears A holier aureole rounds your memories, kept Most fervent-fresh of all the singing spheres, And April-coloured through all months and years. XXVIII You twain fate spared not half your fiery span; The longer date fulfils the lesser man. Ye from beyond the dark dividing date Stand smiling, crowned as gods with foot on fate. For stronger was your blessing than his ban, And earliest whom he struck, he struck too late. XXIX Yet love and loathing, faith and unfaith yet Bind less to greater souls in unison, And one desire that makes three spirits as one Takes great and small as in one spiritual net Woven out of hope toward what shall yet be done Ere hate or love remember or forget. XXX Woven out of faith and hope and love too great To bear the bonds of life and death and fate: Woven out of love and hope and faith too dear To take the print of doubt and change and fear: And interwoven with lines of wrath and hate Blood-red with soils of many a sanguine year. XXXI Who cannot hate, can love not; if he grieve, His tears are barren as the unfruitful rain That rears no harvest from the green sea's plain, And as thorns crackling this man's laugh is vain. Nor can belief touch, kindle, smite, reprieve His heart who has not heart to disbelieve. XXXII But you, most perfect in your hate and love, Our great twin-spirited brethren; you that stand Head by head glittering, hand made fast in hand, And underfoot the fang-drawn worm that strove To wound you living; from so far above, Look love, not scorn, on ours that was your land. XXXIII For love we lack, and help and heat and light To clothe us and to comfort us with might. What help is ours to take or give? but ye— O, more than sunrise to the blind cold sea, That wailed aloud with all her waves all night, Much more, being much more glorious, should you be. XXXIV As fire to frost, as ease to toil, as dew To flowerless fields, as sleep to slackening pain, As hope to souls long weaned from hope again Returning, or as blood revived anew To dry-drawn limbs and every pulseless vein, Even so toward us should no man be but you. XXXV One rose before the sunrise was, and one Before the sunset, lovelier than the sun. And now the heaven is dark and bright and loud With wind and starry drift and moon and cloud, And night's cry rings in straining sheet and shroud, What help is ours if hope like yours be none? XXXVI O well-beloved, our brethren, if ye be, Then are we not forsaken. This kind earth Made fragrant once for all time with your birth, And bright for all men with your love, and worth The clasp and kiss and wedlock of the sea, Were not your mother if not your brethren we. XXXVII Because the days were dark with gods and kings And in time's hand the old hours of time as rods, When force and fear set hope and faith at odds, Ye failed not nor abased your plume-plucked wings; And we that front not more disastrous things, How should we fail in face of kings and gods? XXXVIII For now the deep dense plumes of night are thinned Surely with winnowing of the glimmering wind Whose feet we fledged with morning; and the breath Begins in heaven that sings the dark to death. And all the night wherein men groaned and sinned Sickens at heart to hear what sundawn saith. XXXIX O first-born sons of hope and fairest, ye Whose prows first clove the thought-unsounded sea Whence all the dark dead centuries rose to bar The spirit of man lest truth should make him free, The sunrise and the sunset, seeing one star, Take heart as we to know you that ye are. XL Ye rise not and ye set not; we that say Ye rise and set like hopes that set and rise Look yet but seaward from a land-locked bay; But where at last the sea's line is the sky's And truth and hope one sunlight in your eyes, No sunrise and no sunset marks their day.

The poetry’s arrested in his scene,which can’t be trusted, because I saw it through painkillers that softened my head,after I’d asked him what Keats really meant:“Was it a vision or a waking dream?”—You think that really mattered much to him?In my waking vision dream, there’s no glory,no prize committee or dew-drip Paradise.He’s in an attic nook, or dim garage, or the cellar where he actually writes,the space a sheeted granulated matter, his silenced countenance and de-boned bodyscabby with caked ash about to crust and crack,  poems piled at his feet like shoeshine rags.A grave purpled fraughtness colors him.What damaged him to this silence? He still writes and still isn’t heard, as ifnot being heard is the whole point of it,and who are these children, these wavingHalloween windsocks who won’t talk to him?Beyond my busybody vision, he staggersthrough divorce, stooped, bereft, still writing.Spiky and singing, he out-writes them all,  the cheered, spotless others—he howls at their after-dinner-speaker poetry,the monsignors, the suburbans, the woo-woowisdom merchants weeping to the bank.Poetry’s a weather that doesn’t need a specific place: it’s a storm outside a cellar,sunshine at a bedroom window.Too much schoolroom poisons the idiom.Too much reverence stinks up the joint.The sorrow hanging in the dreamy air seems to confuse him, he can’t understand how his heart came to hurt him like this, confuses it with leaves blurted out by storms,leaves that keep falling fast in the cellar,in poems he writes, the base desires and rage,he says the gods designed the set,stage-manage things, scripted them,the hilarity that hurts us is that none of it really matters,  that poetry’s griefs are intimates           we don’t choose.                        They come to us, for us.                                They cling to body and soul.

is like an african roadmap detailing adventure and
clarity, yet returning to chicago’s south evans

Such splendid icecaps and hard rills, such weights
And counter-weights, I think I scale the heights
When pentatonic Chinese crewmen start
Up in a cold sweat from the bottom of the keyboard
Only to arrive at some snow-stormed valley
To dissolve in steam-holes and vanish out of sight.

The left hand’s library is dull, the books
All read, though sometimes, going under velvet,

Up and down the loudest bowling alley—

Two bird notes endlessly repeat themselves.
Or are they fish scales—iridescent, hard?

Near the sea. And every tree and wave is fake.

Bach is more like opening an ember

at Jackson’s to get some hamburger and be walking back with an
economics book in one hand and meat wrapped in brown paper in the other

would get stopped almost every second time he’d drop in to visit
where are you going and why and how long will you be
someone was always getting busted
someone was always tripping out

here is a journal entry on June 9:
evening of the first ever national leaders debate on TV
“I am looking forward to seeing Trudeau--hope he gets pushed into/onto
answering more directly than he has in the past. I, like many others including
every gay man I know, do have a crush on him: he has much more style than
any Canadian politician so far. I mean style in the true sense of the word, it is
him, not affected… Cliff, of course, doesn’t trust him at all and thinks he’s a sell-
out. I don’t go that far, yet. But I do think that compromising is the only way a
politician can work this country and I do not like all the PR, razzmatazz,
fundraising, and allegiances that go into just getting elected: our system seems

What though the greedy fry Be taken with false baites Of worded balladry, And think it poesy? They die with their conceits, And only piteous scorn upon their folly waits. Then take in hand thy lyre, Strike in thy proper strain, With Japhet's line aspire Sol's chariot for new fire, To give the world again; Who aided him will thee, the issue of Jove's brain. And since our dainty age Cannot endure reproof, Make not thyself a page To that strumpet, the stage, But sing high and aloof, Safe from the wolf's black jaw and the dull ass's hoof.

One afternoon the last week in April
Showing Kai how to throw a hatchet
One-half turn and it sticks in a stump.
He recalls the hatchet-head
Without a handle, in the shop

With the hatchet head
And working hatchet, to the wood block.

Rings in my ears!
""When making an axe handle

It's in Lu Ji's Wên Fu, fourth century

Preface: ""In making the handle
Of an axe
By cutting wood with an axe
The model is indeed near at hand.""

Translated that and taught it years ago

Bird of the bitter bright grey golden morn       Scarce risen upon the dusk of dolorous years, First of us all and sweetest singer born       Whose far shrill note the world of new men hears       Cleave the cold shuddering shade as twilight clears; When song new-born put off the old world's attire And felt its tune on her changed lips expire,       Writ foremost on the roll of them that came Fresh girt for service of the latter lyre,       Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! Alas the joy, the sorrow, and the scorn,       That clothed thy life with hopes and sins and fears, And gave thee stones for bread and tares for corn       And plume-plucked gaol-birds for thy starveling peers       Till death clipt close their flight with shameful shears; Till shifts came short and loves were hard to hire, When lilt of song nor twitch of twangling wire       Could buy thee bread or kisses; when light fame Spurned like a ball and haled through brake and briar,       Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name! Poor splendid wings so frayed and soiled and torn!       Poor kind wild eyes so dashed with light quick tears! Poor perfect voice, most blithe when most forlorn,       That rings athwart the sea whence no man steers       Like joy-bells crossed with death-bells in our ears! What far delight has cooled the fierce desire That like some ravenous bird was strong to tire       On that frail flesh and soul consumed with flame, But left more sweet than roses to respire,       Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name? Prince of sweet songs made out of tears and fire, A harlot was thy nurse, a God thy sire;       Shame soiled thy song, and song assoiled thy shame. But from thy feet now death has washed the mire, Love reads out first at head of all our quire,       Villon, our sad bad glad mad brother's name.

I lived in the first century of world wars.
Most mornings I would be more or less insane,
The newspapers would arrive with their careless stories,
The news would pour out of various devices
Interrupted by attempts to sell products to the unseen.
I would call my friends on other devices;
They would be more or less mad for similar reasons.
Slowly I would get to pen and paper,
Make my poems for others unseen and unborn.
In the day I would be reminded of those men and women,
Brave, setting up signals across vast distances,
Considering a nameless way of living, of almost unimagined values.
As the lights darkened, as the lights of night brightened,
We would try to imagine them, try to find each other,
To construct peace, to make love, to reconcile
Waking with sleeping, ourselves with each other,
Ourselves with ourselves. We would try by any means
To reach the limits of ourselves, to reach beyond ourselves,
To let go the means, to wake.

In Canada, on a dark afternoon,
from a cabin beside Lake Purgatory
I saw your two clenched fists in a tree—
your most recent rage—until I came to my senses,
and saw two small lighted glass lamps reflected
through a window onto the maple leaves.
Was it simply that I had stolen away
in the wilderness to go fishing on your birthday,
twelve years after your death, and you
less than your rusty pliers in my fishing box?
It is late August in the moral North.
To answer your first question,
I obey the fish and game laws
of New York State, Ontario and Quebec.
The odd branch has already turned red.
As for me I have turned inside out,
I cry for revolution against myself—
no longer red, I’m parlor pink and gray,
you, less than a thumb print on a page.
Matters still outstanding: you will not remember—
a boy, I cut school, sneaked out
to the 42nd Street library to read among readers
like a stray lion cub taken into a great pride.
I have kept your Greek grammar,
your 78 revolutions per minute
recording of Rossini’s Barber
you played to stop me from crying,
almost my first memory.
Your “valuable papers,” now valuable
only to me, I fed to a fire years ago.
Frankly I am tired of receiving letters from the dead
every day, and carrying you on my back,
out of the burning city,
in and out of the bathroom and bedroom,
you less than the smoke you wanted for a shroud.
Let us dance with Sarah behind the curtain
where God in his divine humor
tells Abraham Sarah will at ninety bear a son,
and she asks laughing within herself, “Will I have pleasure?”
Take one foot, then the other … Imitate a departure
if you make it not, and each going
will lend a kind of easiness to the next.
Father, you poisoned my father.
I am standing alone, telling the truth
as you commanded. (Without too many
of the unseemly details, like the sounds of you in bed
sucking, I thought, on fruit I later would not eat.)
You, less than a seed of a wild grape.
Today, in the last moments of light
I heard a fish, a “Musky,” your nickname, break water.
As I sing my song of how you
will be remembered, if I could
out of misericordia, I’d tie you to the mast
and stuff your ears with wax. I regret
some parts of the body forgive, some don’t. Father,
do not forget your 18 inch Board of Education ruler
on which I measured my penis, marking its progress.
You kept it on your desk before you till your old age.
One reason, perhaps, for the archaic Greek smile
I wore on my face through boyhood.
I never thought I’d dig your grave with laughter.

Matilda, farewell! Fate has doom’d us to part, But the prospect occasions no pang to my heart; No longer is love with my reason at strife, Though once thou wert dearer, far dearer than life.   As together we roam’d, I the passion confess’d, Which thy beauty and virtue had rais’d in my breast; That the passion was mutual thou mad’st me believe, And I thought my Matilda could never deceive.  My Matilda! no, false one! my claims I resign: Thou canst not, thou must not, thou shalt not be mine: I now scorn thee as much as I lov’d thee before, Nor sigh when I think I shall meet thee no more.  Though fair be thy form, thou no lovers wilt find, While folly and falsehood inhabit thy mind, Though coxcombs may flatter, though ideots may prize, Thou art shunn’d by the good, and contemn’d by the wise.  Than mine what affection more fervent could be, When I thought ev’ry virtue was center’d in thee? Of the vows thou hast broken I will not complain, For I mourn not the loss of a heart I disdain.  Oh! hadst thou but constant and amiable prov’d As that fancied perfection I formerly lov’d, Nor absence, nor time, though supreme their controul, Could have dimm’d the dear image then stamp’d on my soul.  How bright were the pictures, untinted with shade, By Hope’s glowing pencil on Fancy pourtray’d! Sweet visions of bliss! which I could not retain; For they, like thyself, were deceitful and vain.  Some other, perhaps, to Matilda is dear, Some other, more pleasing, though not more sincere; May he fix thy light passions, now wav’ring as air, Then leave thee, inconstant, to shame and despair!  Repent not, Matilda, return not to me: Unavailing thy grief, thy repentance will be: In vain will thy vows or thy smiles be resum’d, For love, once extinguish’d, is never relum’d.

I know the ways of learning; both the headAnd pipes that feed the press, and make it run;What reason hath from nature borrowed,Or of itself, like a good huswife, spunIn laws and policy; what the stars conspire,What willing nature speaks, what forc'd by fire;Both th'old discoveries and the new-found seas,The stock and surplus, cause and history;All these stand open, or I have the keys:
     Yet I love thee.I know the ways of honour; what maintainsThe quick returns of courtesy and wit;In vies of favours whether party gainsWhen glory swells the heart and moldeth itTo all expressions both of hand and eye,Which on the world a true-love-knot may tie,And bear the bundle wheresoe'er it goes;How many drams of spirit there must beTo sell my life unto my friends or foes:
     Yet I love thee.I know the ways of pleasure; the sweet strainsThe lullings and the relishes of it;The propositions of hot blood and brains;What mirth and music mean; what love and witHave done these twenty hundred years and more;I know the projects of unbridled store;My stuff is flesh, not brass; my senses live,And grumble oft that they have more in meThan he that curbs them, being but one to five:
     Yet I love thee.I know all these and have them in my hand;Therefore not seeled but with open eyesI fly to thee, and fully understandBoth the main sale and the commodities;And at what rate and price I have thy love,With all the circumstances that may move.Yet through the labyrinths, not my grovelling wit,But thy silk twist let down from heav'n to meDid both conduct and teach me how by it
     To climb to thee.

It’s not so easy to smash the compass.
To rely on the winds     the golden hum of
Herb Kane clouds navigating
the tips of these mountains.
It’s not so easy to modify the compass.
To apologize when your brothers
are spreading the sashimi
and churning the shoyu mustard.
It’s not so easy to ignore the compass
because it seems to have always been here
in all its sextant glory     pointing
distracting you from Wākea’s blue teeth nibbling Papa’s chest.
It’s not so easy     but it’s possible
to say “aloha, for now” to family and friends
pouring bags of ice into clean coolers
before the big show.
To walk past uncle’s squid lū‘au bubbling green,
to get in that car and drive, with nothing
but a fistful of quarters
for the library Xerox machine.
It’s possible     because when those books
slide across the counter and you walk
to an empty table     the compass begins to shake
and the needle is never the same    again.
With every turn of a Pacific page
you realize      pukas are being filled
or new ones      uncovered.
And the art of listening brings with it memories,
of the physics of his hips and hands     when you first saw him
cast that net     slicing the horizon.
The needle doesn’t like it when you flatten the cube
to discover your kūpuna were always
just around the corner    from where you sit      now.
And the halftime show hasn’t even started, yet.
The time it takes to get from the third million-dollar commercial
to the fifth     is equal to the time it takes to find the Kānaka Maoli name
of the land that raised you     buried under the pavements     under
the brand new      two-lane     fast food      drive-thru.
But what the compass really hates      what it’s really afraid of
is when you see the lo‘i in the same way that you see
that empty Sunday afternoon library     when you finally
see the moana in your kūpuna’s eye.
So now      when you return home and the cooler is empty
and the sashimi spiral is nearly gone   unfurl
those Xerox copies across the dining table     consoling
the cousins who lost money on the spread.
And as the compass repairs itself    as it always does
it will feel the sting when it finds you       tomorrow
with your back being warmed by the morning sun.

They look
Like Big
Strong hands
Don’t they?
But for some
They are eerily reminiscent
Of drunken stepfathers who didn’t listen
Abusive lovers
Who didn’t ask permission
Of bullies
Who never got to see the gold within
’Cause they were too busyfracking the aether out of Innocents
These Bronze Hands
Give people flashbacks of Brass Knuckles
Tall, dark, and sinister
Skip across their eyelids
Wary of their trinkets
These hands
Look like they would snatch their children out of the night
Fright
In the eyes of a stranger
Is hard to chisel away
So I choose to dispel the myths and preconceived notions
Not all giants from the ocean are created violent
Some of us
Dream of violin solos
While fumbling with a lack of nimble
Sometimes
These Big, Strong hands
Are too small to cradle all these broken dreams
I hold them too close, I suppose
The pitter-patter of shattered hopes on tattered heart-strings
Are a practiced tune
These fingers sing
Sometimes
They make me a target
So many Napoléons
Want their volley to knock the nose off the sphinx
So I meandered to the metamorphosis of these metacarpals into mandible
munchers and it made me malignant
They look
Like big ol’ meat mashers
don’t they
These boulders
Used to reduce mountains into molehills
But though they Once Were Warriors
These old soldiers gather moss now
They’ve seen enough violence for two lifetimes and have since retired
They beg forgiveness
For sinning against their brothers
And taking up arms against them
Nobody ever asks me what I see
’Cause to me
They look like blame the big kid
For defending himself against the antagonistic little shit
with the chip on his shoulder
They look like
These big digits won’t fit fingertip thimble kisses
They look like high-roller scapegoats
And tactile regret
I know
What they look like
But they are
Grandpa’s fissures filled with pride in combing my hair
They’re Grandma’s amethyst veins helping me cross cracked pavement
They’re dad’s throwing discus
My Uncle’s shooting hoops
My brothers playing music
Regardless of what they look like
My hands are Large
And Powerful
From a long line of love
With no time for the presumptionsOf Mice and Men
My hands
Were trained by Earth mothers
Who let ‘Ōlelo Hawai‘i roll thunder ’cross the valleys and echo from the
Cliffs
My granite palms
Are diamonds in the rough
Smooth enough to wipe away little streams from Northern Springs
And put pressure on cuts
To stop rivulets from leaking
My hands
Massage
Caress
Intertwine
And Heal
Move nimbly with knot work
They tremble and quake
They help me stand up straight
My hands can stand the heat
So that even while it’s still molten
They will help shape
The golden heart
Within the next

I am locked in a little cedar box
with a picture of shepherds pasted onto
the central panel between carvings.

way out of the closed box
redolent of cedar. Satan
comes to me in the locked box
and says, I’ll get you out. SayMy father is a shit. I say
my father is a shit and Satan
laughs and says, It’s opening.Say your mother is a pimp.
My mother is a pimp. Something
opens and breaks when I say that.
My spine uncurls in the cedar box
like the pink back of the ballerina pin
with a ruby eye, resting beside me on
satin in the cedar box.Say shit, say death, say fuck the father,
Satan says, down my ear.
The pain of the locked past buzzes
in the child’s box on her bureau, under
the terrible round pond eye
etched around with roses, where
self-loathing gazed at sorrow.
Shit. Death. Fuck the father.
Something opens. Satan saysDon’t you feel a lot better?
Light seems to break on the delicate
edelweiss pin, carved in two
colors of wood. I love him too,
you know, I say to Satan dark
in the locked box. I love them but
I’m trying to say what happened to us
in the lost past. Of course, he says
and smiles, of course. Now say: torture. 
I see, through blackness soaked in cedar,
the edge of a large hinge open.Say: the father’s cock, the mother’scunt, says Satan, I’ll get you out.
The angle of the hinge widens
until I see the outlines of
the time before I was, when they were
locked in the bed. When I say
the magic words, Cock, Cunt,
Satan softly says, Come out.
But the air around the opening
is heavy and thick as hot smoke.Come in, he says, and I feel his voice
breathing from the opening.
The exit is through Satan’s mouth.Come in my mouth, he says, you’re therealready, and the huge hinge
begins to close. Oh no, I loved
them, too, I brace
my body tight
in the cedar house.
Satan sucks himself out the keyhole.
I’m left locked in the box, he seals
the heart-shaped lock with the wax of his tongue.It’s your coffin now, Satan says.

         The aeroplane shifts round and faces the charging bull.
         As the bull comes in the propeller takes off the end of its muzzle. The bloody nostrils, a ring through them, are flung to the grass with a shattered blossom of teeth.
         The bull, blood oozing from the stump of its face, backs off, and charges again. This time the propeller catches the bull behind its lower jaw and flings the head into a tree.
         The headless bull backs off once more, and then charges down again. The propeller beating at the headless bull, cutting the body away in a great halo of blood, until only the back legs are standing. These run widely away through the meadow in figure eights and zigzags, until at last they find the aeroplane again. And as they come running down the propeller whacks them apart.
         The legs, one with the tail still attached to it, the other somehow retaining both rectum and testicles, scamper off in opposite directions.

he gave way because his bladder would not go on,

                ","
Isn't it always the heart that wants to wash
the elephant, begging the body to do it
with soap and water, a ladder, hands,
in tree-shade big enough for the vast savannahs
of your sadness, the strangler fig of your guilt,
the cratered full moon's light fueling
the windy spooling memory of elephant?
What if Father Quinn had said, ""Of course you'll recognize
your parents in heaven,"" instead of
""Being one with God will make your mother and father
pointless."" That was back when I was young enough
to love them absolutely though still fear for their place
in heaven, imagining their souls like sponges full
of something resembling street water after rain.
Still my mother sent me every Saturday to confess,
to wring the sins out of my small baffled soul, and I made up lies
about lying, disobeying, chewing gum in church, to offer them
as carefully as I handed over the knotted handkercheif of coins
to the grocer when my mother sent me for a loaf of Wonder,
Land O'Lakes, and two Camels.
If guilt is the damage of childhood, then eros is the fall of adolescence.
Of the fall begins there, and never ends, desire after desire parading
through a lifetime like the Ringling Brothers elephants
made to walk through the Queens-Midtown Tuunnel
and down 34th Street to the Garden.
So much of our desire like their bulky, shadowy walking
after midnight, exiled from the wild and destined
for a circus with its tawdry gaudiness, its unspoken
pathos. 
It takes more than half a century to figure out who they were,
the few real loves-of-your-life and how much of the rest—
the mad breaking-heart stickiness—falls away, slowly,
unnoticed, the way you lose your taste for things
like Popsicles unthinkingly.
And though dailiness may have no place
for the ones that have etched themselves in the laugh lines
and frown lines on the face that's harder and harder
to claim as your own, often one love-of-your-life
will appear in a dream, arriving
with the weight and certitude of an elephant,
and it's always the heart that wants to go out and wash
the huge mysteriousness of what they meant, those memories
that have only memories to feed them, and only you to keep them clean.

Pass by the showy rose, blabbing open, suckling a shiny beetle; pass by the changeless diamond that falls asleep in shadow— this love is a lichen, alga and fungus made one fleck, feeding on what it feeds, growing slightly faster than stone into a patch of gray lace, a double thumbprint, its bloom distinguishable, with practice, from its dormant phase, crocheting its singular habit over time, a faithful stain bound to its home, etching on the unmoved rock the only rune it knows.

The black ox hours limped toward Sunday’s sun,
Across a buff clay belt with scrawls of stone,
Where bird and beast quailed in the bosom brush
From February’s fang and claw; the stars,
Blue white, like sheer icicles, spired aglow
As if the three wise men barged in the East
Or priests in sackcloth balked the Scourge of God.
 
Foursquare by the rite of arm and heart and law,
The scrubby log cabin dared the compass points
Of Rock Spring farm, man’s world, God’s universe,
The babel of the circumstance and era.
The frozen socket of its window stared
Beyond the spayed crabapple trees, to where
The skulls of hills, the skeletons of barrens,
Lay quiet as time without the watch’s tick.

The black and bristling hair, the acids of thoughts
Made of the orby face an etching-plate.

Near pyrotechnic logs, the purling kettle,
Aunt Peggy puffed her pipe on God’s rich time:
A granny at a childbed on the border,
Where head and backbone answered the tomahawk
Her wise old eyes had seen a hundred Nancys
In travail tread the dark winepress alone;
Her wise old hands had plucked a stubborn breed
Into the outer world of pitch and toss.
 
The cabin that her myth and mission entered
Became a castle in which Aunt Peggy throned
A dynasty of grunts and nods and glances.
The nest, the barn, the hovel had schooled her in
The ABC of motherhood, and somehow
She’d lost her ego in the commonweal:
She sensed so accurately a coming child
That rakes dubbed her the St. Bernard of Sex!
 
And now her keyhole look explored Tom Lincoln
Beneath the patched homespun, the hue and cry
Of malice, until she touched his loneliness,
The taproot that his fiber gave no tongue.
Then, lulling the wife, troubled in flesh and mind,
She eased the sack quilts higher and mused the while:
There’s but one way of coming into the world,
And seven times seventy ways of leaving it!

The woman Nancy, like a voyager sucked
Into the sea’s whale belly by a wreck,
Buoyed to the surface air of consciousness

Cuddled in dark brown hair; her eyes waxed grayer
With wonder of the interlude: her beauty
And courage choked Aunt Peggy’s hyperbole!
 
Out of the fog of pain, the bog of bygones,
The bag of cabin cant and tavern tattle,
She picked the squares to piece tomorrow’s quilt:
She puzzled now, as then, about her father
Who let wild Lucy Hanks bundle and carry
Flesh of his flesh beyond the Cumberland Gap;
A strange roof is no roof when imps of fear
Pilfer the fatherless in blossom time.
 
Year in, year out, the daughter tinkered with
The riddle of her birth; the mother chided
The woman Nancy as she had the child,
“Hush thee, hush thee, thy father’s a gentleman.”
The butt of bawd, grand jury, Sunday bonnet,
Lucy, driven, taught her daughter the Word,
And Nancy, driven, taught her son the Word,

The man Tom bit his fingernails, then rammed
His pockets with the hector hands that gave
Raw timber the shape of cabinet and coffin,
And in his lame speech said: “Aunt Peggy, listen,
Now that our Nancy’s time is come, I’m haunted
By my own nothingness. Why breed nobodies?”
He tapped the dirt floor with the iron-capped boot
That aided fist and skull in border fights.
 
Aunt Peggy counseled: “Tom, you say the say
Poor Joseph probably said in that low stable
Ere Jesus came into this mishmash world.”
She paused, then boxed the ears of cynicism:
“It’s true, down in the barnyard, blood speaks loud,
Among the hogs, the chickens, the cows, the horses;
But, when it comes to Man, who knows, who knows
What greatness feeds down in the lowliest mother?”
 
The man Tom turned and spat: his naked surmise
Ranged out and out. Aunt Peggy’s innermost said:
“Your father Abraham, bred like Daniel Boone,
Conquered a land with gun and ax and plow,
Baptized it in his blood! I say, I’ve said,
What’s in a baby is God Almighty’s business;
How the elders wring it out is worry enough!
The best, the worst—it’s all, all human nature.”

The tavern, Tom remembered, the New Year’s Eve,
The clubfoot scholar bagged in Old World clothes,
With arrowy eyes and a hoary mushroom beard.
An Oxford don, he hymned the Bastille’s fall
In spite of the hair-hung sword; his betters set
Him free to hail new truths in new lands, where
He seined with slave and master, knave and priest,
And out of all fished up the rights of man:
 
“As Citizen Lincoln asks, ‘What’s human nature?’
His full mug says a clear mind puts the question
Which ties the fogey scholar in a knot!
My new idea fed to his new baby
Would fetch the New World and the New Year peace!
The sum of anything unriddles the riddle:
The child whose wet nurse is the mother-of-all
Grows like a pine unmarked by rock or wind.
 
“To make a New World and a New Year, Plato
And Jesus begged the boon of little children!
Now Citizen Lincoln asks, ‘What’s human nature?’
It’s what we elders have: no baby has it.
It’s what our good and bad graft on the neutral.
It’s what our rulers feed the boy and girl.
It’s what society garbs nature in.
It’s a misnomer: call it human nurture!”

Aunt Peggy hovered closer, with flawless rites
Grown lyrical from habit: muffled pain sounds
Dragged from the bed of cleated poles; she hawed
Tom Lincoln, as one turns a nag aside,
Then swooped her way, even as a setting hen
Carves a dictatorship from yard to nest.
And Tom again was squeezed into a cell
Whose inmates were the ghosts of unsuccess.
 
Later his memories climbed a gala peak,
His Nancy’s infare that ran riotous:
The bear meat, venison, wild turkey, duck,
The maple sugar hanging for the whiskey,
The red ham, gourds of syrup, bowls of honey,
The wood coal pit with brown and juicy sheep,
The guzzling, fiddling, guttling, monkeyshining:
A continent sprawled between that day and this!
 
A havenot on the frontier is no havenot;
A Crusoe without Friday has no conscience:
Yet Tom’s grub living gnawed him like the teeth
Of slavery, land titles, melancholy.
He, like his forebears, visioned a Promised Land
And tidied ways and means to fly the barrens
That doomed the flesh to peck, to patch, to pinch,
And wrung the soul of joy and beauty dry.

The black ox hours limped by, and day crawled after.
White prongs of ice, like dinosaur fangs, gleamed in
The cavernous mouth of Rock Spring; snowbirds shivered
And chirped rebellion; a cow with jags and gaps
Chewed emptily; hogs squealed in hunger fits;
And scrags of dogs huddled against the chimney,
Which shoveled smoke dust into the throats and noses
Of ragged winds kicking up snow in the desert.
 
Nancy lay white, serene, like virgin milk
After the udder’s fury in the pail.
Beneath the sack quilts and the bearskin robe,
In yellow petticoat and linsey shirt,
The baby snuggled at her breast and gurgled—
An anonymity of soft red wrinkles.
Aunt Peggy, hovering, grinned, “He’s Sabbath-born.
Remember …Sunday—it’s red-letter day!”
 
Like ax and helve, like scythe and snath, the bond
Held Tom and Nancy; she smiled at his halt smile,
His titan’s muss in picking up the baby.
Tom frowned and spat, then gulped, “He’s legs! All legs!”
Aunt Peggy beamed, “Long legs can eat up miles.”
Tom gloomed, “The hands—look at the axman’s hands!”
And Nancy mused, “The Hankses’ dream, the Lincolns’,
Needs such a man to hew and blaze the way.”

                ","
Day after day of rain. A ticket straight to
the mild-mannered hell of rethinking whatever,
the drive to EconoFoods: not a lot of grief in that.
You need staples — bread, rice, eggs.
Here’s a list: almonds, yogurt, all the little
anti-griefs add up.
Did I tell you? my grandfather sings from the grave.
They have my old Philco here.
I know all about your world of godawful and too bad.
I keep driving. In rain. Some luck required. Stop light.
Flashy cars on both sides playing radios too loud.
Ear damage! I used to shout out the window,
my boy in the front seat trying hard to shrink, not to know
who is that crazy at the wheel.
Grandfather likes saying: what? Half-deaf even now.
Half a lot of things, anytime. Half, what gives?
giving way. If there is a we or a you or an I finally.
He’d cup an ear if he had an ear.
So it is, the first anti-grief, a feather he picked up.
My childhood, walking with
the oldest man I ever, 1874 his
start date. Alarm and Should Have, two roads
he would not cross, and Consequence
a street over, he ignored completely. Always
an eye out for the great
small peculiar.
A feather. Sometimes handed to me. Or he’d
oil a clock with it right off the curb.
Into a pocket.

Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That sends the frozen-ground-swell under it,
And spills the upper boulders in the sun;
And makes gaps even two can pass abreast.
The work of hunters is another thing:
I have come after them and made repair
Where they have left not one stone on a stone,
But they would have the rabbit out of hiding,
To please the yelping dogs. The gaps I mean,
No one has seen them made or heard them made,
But at spring mending-time we find them there.
I let my neighbour know beyond the hill;
And on a day we meet to walk the line
And set the wall between us once again.
We keep the wall between us as we go.
To each the boulders that have fallen to each.
And some are loaves and some so nearly balls
We have to use a spell to make them balance:
""Stay where you are until our backs are turned!""
We wear our fingers rough with handling them.
Oh, just another kind of out-door game,
One on a side. It comes to little more:
There where it is we do not need the wall:
He is all pine and I am apple orchard.
My apple trees will never get across
And eat the cones under his pines, I tell him.
He only says, ""Good fences make good neighbours.""
Spring is the mischief in me, and I wonder
If I could put a notion in his head:""Why do they make good neighbours? Isn't it
Where there are cows? But here there are no cows.
Before I built a wall I'd ask to know
What I was walling in or walling out,
And to whom I was like to give offence.
Something there is that doesn't love a wall,
That wants it down."" I could say ""Elves"" to him,
But it's not elves exactly, and I'd rather
He said it for himself. I see him there
Bringing a stone grasped firmly by the top
In each hand, like an old-stone savage armed.
He moves in darkness as it seems to me,
Not of woods only and the shade of trees.
He will not go behind his father's saying,
And he likes having thought of it so well
He says again, ""Good fences make good neighbours.""

Already April’s reign is o’er, Her evening tints delight no more; No more the violet scents the gale, No more the mist o’erspreads the vale; The lovely queen of smiles and tears, Who gave thee birth, no more appears; But blushing May, with brow serene, And vestments of a livelier green, Commands the winged choir to sing, And with wild notes the meadows ring.    O come! ere all the train is gone, No more to hail thy twenty-one; That age which higher honour shares, And well become the wreath it wears.

Foreword to “Dancing on the Grave of a Son of a Bitch”

This poem is more properly a “dance poem” than a song or chant because the element of repetition is created by movements of language rather than duplicating words and sounds. However, it is in the spirit of ritual recitation that I wrote it/ a performance to drive away bad spirits perhaps.

The story behind the poem is this: a man and woman who have been living together for some time separate. Part of the pain of separation involves possessions which they had shared. They both angrily believe they should have what they want. She asks for some possession and he denies her the right to it. She replies that she gave him money for a possession which he has and therefore should have what she wants now. He replies that she has forgotten that for the number of years they lived together he never charged her rent and if he had she would now owe him $7,000.

She is appalled that he equates their history with a sum of money. She is even more furious to realize that this sum of money represents the entire rent on the apartment and implies that he should not have paid anything at all. She is furious. She kills him mentally. Once and for all she decides she is well rid of this man and that she shouldn’t feel sad at their parting. She decides to prove to herself that she’s glad he’s gone from her life. With joy she will dance on all the bad memories of their life together.

Henbane is too good for you,

because we want to dance,
we want to sing,
we want to throw this old man

but they are too beautiful for him, singing in harmony

will sing on your grave, old man

Asleep or waking is it? for her neck, Kissed over close, wears yet a purple speck       Wherein the pained blood falters and goes out; Soft, and stung softly — fairer for a fleck. But though my lips shut sucking on the place, There is no vein at work upon her face;       Her eyelids are so peaceable, no doubt Deep sleep has warmed her blood through all its ways. Lo, this is she that was the world's delight; The old grey years were parcels of her might;       The strewings of the ways wherein she trod Were the twain seasons of the day and night. Lo, she was thus when her clear limbs enticed All lips that now grow sad with kissing Christ,       Stained with blood fallen from the feet of God, The feet and hands whereat our souls were priced. Alas, Lord, surely thou art great and fair. But lo her wonderfully woven hair!       And thou didst heal us with thy piteous kiss; But see now, Lord; her mouth is lovelier. She is right fair; what hath she done to thee? Nay, fair Lord Christ, lift up thine eyes and see;       Had now thy mother such a lip — like this? Thou knowest how sweet a thing it is to me. Inside the Horsel here the air is hot; Right little peace one hath for it, God wot;       The scented dusty daylight burns the air, And my heart chokes me till I hear it not. Behold, my Venus, my soul's body, lies With my love laid upon her garment-wise,       Feeling my love in all her limbs and hair And shed between her eyelids through her eyes. She holds my heart in her sweet open hands Hanging asleep; hard by her head there stands,       Crowned with gilt thorns and clothed with flesh like fire, Love, wan as foam blown up the salt burnt sands — Hot as the brackish waifs of yellow spume That shift and steam — loose clots of arid fume       From the sea's panting mouth of dry desire; There stands he, like one labouring at a loom. The warp holds fast across; and every thread That makes the woof up has dry specks of red;       Always the shuttle cleaves clean through, and he Weaves with the hair of many a ruined head. Love is not glad nor sorry, as I deem; Labouring he dreams, and labours in the dream,       Till when the spool is finished, lo I see His web, reeled off, curls and goes out like steam. Night falls like fire; the heavy lights run low, And as they drop, my blood and body so       Shake as the flame shakes, full of days and hours That sleep not neither weep they as they go. Ah yet would God this flesh of mine might be Where air might wash and long leaves cover me,       Where tides of grass break into foam of flowers, Or where the wind's feet shine along the sea. Ah yet would God that stems and roots were bred Out of my weary body and my head,       That sleep were sealed upon me with a seal, And I were as the least of all his dead. Would God my blood were dew to feed the grass, Mine ears made deaf and mine eyes blind as glass,       My body broken as a turning wheel, And my mouth stricken ere it saith Alas! Ah God, that love were as a flower or flame, That life were as the naming of a name,       That death were not more pitiful than desire, That these things were not one thing and the same! Behold now, surely somewhere there is death: For each man hath some space of years, he saith,       A little space of time ere time expire, A little day, a little way of breath. And lo, between the sundawn and the sun, His day's work and his night's work are undone;       And lo, between the nightfall and the light, He is not, and none knoweth of such an one. Ah God, that I were as all souls that be, As any herb or leaf of any tree,       As men that toil through hours of labouring night, As bones of men under the deep sharp sea. Outside it must be winter among men; For at the gold bars of the gates again       I heard all night and all the hours of it The wind's wet wings and fingers drip with rain. Knights gather, riding sharp for cold; I know The ways and woods are strangled with the snow;       And with short song the maidens spin and sit Until Christ's birthnight, lily-like, arow. The scent and shadow shed about me make The very soul in all my senses ache;       The hot hard night is fed upon my breath, And sleep beholds me from afar awake. Alas, but surely where the hills grow deep, Or where the wild ways of the sea are steep,       Or in strange places somewhere there is death, And on death's face the scattered hair of sleep. There lover-like with lips and limbs that meet They lie, they pluck sweet fruit of life and eat;       But me the hot and hungry days devour, And in my mouth no fruit of theirs is sweet. No fruit of theirs, but fruit of my desire, For her love's sake whose lips through mine respire;       Her eyelids on her eyes like flower on flower, Mine eyelids on mine eyes like fire on fire. So lie we, not as sleep that lies by death, With heavy kisses and with happy breath;       Not as man lies by woman, when the bride Laughs low for love's sake and the words he saith. For she lies, laughing low with love; she lies And turns his kisses on her lips to sighs,       To sighing sound of lips unsatisfied, And the sweet tears are tender with her eyes. Ah, not as they, but as the souls that were Slain in the old time, having found her fair;       Who, sleeping with her lips upon their eyes, Heard sudden serpents hiss across her hair. Their blood runs round the roots of time like rain: She casts them forth and gathers them again;       With nerve and bone she weaves and multiplies Exceeding pleasure out of extreme pain. Her little chambers drip with flower-like red, Her girdles, and the chaplets of her head,       Her armlets and her anklets; with her feet She tramples all that winepress of the dead. Her gateways smoke with fume of flowers and fires, With loves burnt out and unassuaged desires;       Between her lips the steam of them is sweet, The languor in her ears of many lyres. Her beds are full of perfume and sad sound, Her doors are made with music, and barred round       With sighing and with laughter and with tears, With tears whereby strong souls of men are bound. There is the knight Adonis that was slain; With flesh and blood she chains him for a chain;       The body and the spirit in her ears Cry, for her lips divide him vein by vein. Yea, all she slayeth; yea, every man save me; Me, love, thy lover that must cleave to thee       Till the ending of the days and ways of earth, The shaking of the sources of the sea. Me, most forsaken of all souls that fell; Me, satiated with things insatiable;       Me, for whose sake the extreme hell makes mirth, Yea, laughter kindles at the heart of hell. Alas thy beauty! for thy mouth's sweet sake My soul is bitter to me, my limbs quake       As water, as the flesh of men that weep, As their heart's vein whose heart goes nigh to break. Ah God, that sleep with flower-sweet finger-tips Would crush the fruit of death upon my lips;       Ah God, that death would tread the grapes of sleep And wring their juice upon me as it drips. There is no change of cheer for many days, But change of chimes high up in the air, that sways       Rung by the running fingers of the wind; And singing sorrows heard on hidden ways. Day smiteth day in twain, night sundereth night, And on mine eyes the dark sits as the light;       Yea, Lord, thou knowest I know not, having sinned, If heaven be clean or unclean in thy sight. Yea, as if earth were sprinkled over me, Such chafed harsh earth as chokes a sandy sea,       Each pore doth yearn, and the dried blood thereof Gasps by sick fits, my heart swims heavily, There is a feverish famine in my veins; Below her bosom, where a crushed grape stains       The white and blue, there my lips caught and clove An hour since, and what mark of me remains? I dare not always touch her, lest the kiss Leave my lips charred. Yea, Lord, a little bliss,       Brief bitter bliss, one hath for a great sin; Nathless thou knowest how sweet a thing it is. Sin, is it sin whereby men's souls are thrust Into the pit? yet had I a good trust       To save my soul before it slipped therein, Trod under by the fire-shod feet of lust. For if mine eyes fail and my soul takes breath, I look between the iron sides of death       Into sad hell where all sweet love hath end, All but the pain that never finisheth. There are the naked faces of great kings, The singing folk with all their lute-playings;       There when one cometh he shall have to friend The grave that covets and the worm that clings. There sit the knights that were so great of hand, The ladies that were queens of fair green land,       Grown grey and black now, brought unto the dust, Soiled, without raiment, clad about with sand. There is one end for all of them; they sit Naked and sad, they drink the dregs of it,       Trodden as grapes in the wine-press of lust, Trampled and trodden by the fiery feet. I see the marvellous mouth whereby there fell Cities and people whom the gods loved well,       Yet for her sake on them the fire gat hold, And for their sakes on her the fire of hell. And softer than the Egyptian lote-leaf is, The queen whose face was worth the world to kiss,       Wearing at breast a suckling snake of gold; And large pale lips of strong Semiramis, Curled like a tiger's that curl back to feed; Red only where the last kiss made them bleed;       Her hair most thick with many a carven gem, Deep in the mane, great-chested, like a steed. Yea, with red sin the faces of them shine; But in all these there was no sin like mine;       No, not in all the strange great sins of them That made the wine-press froth and foam with wine. For I was of Christ's choosing, I God's knight, No blinkard heathen stumbling for scant light;       I can well see, for all the dusty days Gone past, the clean great time of goodly fight. I smell the breathing battle sharp with blows, With shriek of shafts and snapping short of bows;       The fair pure sword smites out in subtle ways, Sounds and long lights are shed between the rows Of beautiful mailed men; the edged light slips, Most like a snake that takes short breath and dips       Sharp from the beautifully bending head, With all its gracious body lithe as lips That curl in touching you; right in this wise My sword doth, seeming fire in mine own eyes,       Leaving all colours in them brown and red And flecked with death; then the keen breaths like sighs, The caught-up choked dry laughters following them, When all the fighting face is grown a flame       For pleasure, and the pulse that stuns the ears, And the heart's gladness of the goodly game. Let me think yet a little; I do know These things were sweet, but sweet such years ago,       Their savour is all turned now into tears; Yea, ten years since, where the blue ripples blow, The blue curled eddies of the blowing Rhine, I felt the sharp wind shaking grass and vine       Touch my blood too, and sting me with delight Through all this waste and weary body of mine That never feels clear air; right gladly then I rode alone, a great way off my men,       And heard the chiming bridle smite and smite, And gave each rhyme thereof some rhyme again, Till my song shifted to that iron one; Seeing there rode up between me and the sun       Some certain of my foe's men, for his three White wolves across their painted coats did run. The first red-bearded, with square cheeks — alack, I made my knave's blood turn his beard to black;       The slaying of him was a joy to see: Perchance too, when at night he came not back, Some woman fell a-weeping, whom this thief Would beat when he had drunken; yet small grief       Hath any for the ridding of such knaves; Yea, if one wept, I doubt her teen was brief. This bitter love is sorrow in all lands, Draining of eyelids, wringing of drenched hands,       Sighing of hearts and filling up of graves; A sign across the head of the world he stands, An one that hath a plague-mark on his brows; Dust and spilt blood do track him to his house       Down under earth; sweet smells of lip and cheek, Like a sweet snake's breath made more poisonous With chewing of some perfumed deadly grass, Are shed all round his passage if he pass,       And their quenched savour leaves the whole soul weak, Sick with keen guessing whence the perfume was. As one who hidden in deep sedge and reeds Smells the rare scent made where a panther feeds,       And tracking ever slotwise the warm smell Is snapped upon by the sweet mouth and bleeds, His head far down the hot sweet throat of her — So one tracks love, whose breath is deadlier,       And lo, one springe and you are fast in hell, Fast as the gin's grip of a wayfarer. I think now, as the heavy hours decease One after one, and bitter thoughts increase       One upon one, of all sweet finished things; The breaking of the battle; the long peace Wherein we sat clothed softly, each man's hair Crowned with green leaves beneath white hoods of vair;       The sounds of sharp spears at great tourneyings, And noise of singing in the late sweet air. I sang of love too, knowing nought thereof; ""Sweeter,"" I said, ""the little laugh of love       Than tears out of the eyes of Magdalen, Or any fallen feather of the Dove. ""The broken little laugh that spoils a kiss, The ache of purple pulses, and the bliss       Of blinded eyelids that expand again — Love draws them open with those lips of his, ""Lips that cling hard till the kissed face has grown Of one same fire and colour with their own;       Then ere one sleep, appeased with sacrifice, Where his lips wounded, there his lips atone."" I sang these things long since and knew them not; ""Lo, here is love, or there is love, God wot,       This man and that finds favour in his eyes,"" I said, ""but I, what guerdon have I got? ""The dust of praise that is blown everywhere In all men's faces with the common air;       The bay-leaf that wants chafing to be sweet Before they wind it in a singer's hair."" So that one dawn I rode forth sorrowing; I had no hope but of some evil thing,       And so rode slowly past the windy wheat And past the vineyard and the water-spring, Up to the Horsel. A great elder-tree Held back its heaps of flowers to let me see       The ripe tall grass, and one that walked therein, Naked, with hair shed over to the knee. She walked between the blossom and the grass; I knew the beauty of her, what she was,       The beauty of her body and her sin, And in my flesh the sin of hers, alas! Alas! for sorrow is all the end of this. O sad kissed mouth, how sorrowful it is!       O breast whereat some suckling sorrow clings, Red with the bitter blossom of a kiss! Ah, with blind lips I felt for you, and found About my neck your hands and hair enwound,       The hands that stifle and the hair that stings, I felt them fasten sharply without sound. Yea, for my sin I had great store of bliss: Rise up, make answer for me, let thy kiss       Seal my lips hard from speaking of my sin, Lest one go mad to hear how sweet it is. Yet I waxed faint with fume of barren bowers, And murmuring of the heavy-headed hours;       And let the dove's beak fret and peck within My lips in vain, and Love shed fruitless flowers. So that God looked upon me when your hands Were hot about me; yea, God brake my bands       To save my soul alive, and I came forth Like a man blind and naked in strange lands That hears men laugh and weep, and knows not whence Nor wherefore, but is broken in his sense;       Howbeit I met folk riding from the north Towards Rome, to purge them of their souls' offence, And rode with them, and spake to none; the day Stunned me like lights upon some wizard way,       And ate like fire mine eyes and mine eyesight; So rode I, hearing all these chant and pray, And marvelled; till before us rose and fell White cursed hills, like outer skirts of hell       Seen where men's eyes look through the day to night, Like a jagged shell's lips, harsh, untunable, Blown in between by devils' wrangling breath; Nathless we won well past that hell and death,       Down to the sweet land where all airs are good, Even unto Rome where God's grace tarrieth. Then came each man and worshipped at his knees Who in the Lord God's likeness bears the keys       To bind or loose, and called on Christ's shed blood, And so the sweet-souled father gave him ease. But when I came I fell down at his feet, Saying, ""Father, though the Lord's blood be right sweet,       The spot it takes not off the panther's skin, Nor shall an Ethiop's stain be bleached with it. ""Lo, I have sinned and have spat out at God, Wherefore his hand is heavier and his rod       More sharp because of mine exceeding sin, And all his raiment redder than bright blood ""Before mine eyes; yea, for my sake I wot The heat of hell is waxen seven times hot       Through my great sin."" Then spake he some sweet word, Giving me cheer; which thing availed me not; Yea, scarce I wist if such indeed were said; For when I ceased — lo, as one newly dead       Who hears a great cry out of hell, I heard The crying of his voice across my head. ""Until this dry shred staff, that hath no whit Of leaf nor bark, bear blossom and smell sweet,       Seek thou not any mercy in God's sight, For so long shalt thou be cast out from it."" Yea, what if dried-up stems wax red and green, Shall that thing be which is not nor has been?       Yea, what if sapless bark wax green and white, Shall any good fruit grow upon my sin? Nay, though sweet fruit were plucked of a dry tree, And though men drew sweet waters of the sea,       There should not grow sweet leaves on this dead stem, This waste wan body and shaken soul of me. Yea, though God search it warily enough, There is not one sound thing in all thereof;       Though he search all my veins through, searching them He shall find nothing whole therein but love. For I came home right heavy, with small cheer, And lo my love, mine own soul's heart, more dear       Than mine own soul, more beautiful than God, Who hath my being between the hands of her — Fair still, but fair for no man saving me, As when she came out of the naked sea       Making the foam as fire whereon she trod, And as the inner flower of fire was she. Yea, she laid hold upon me, and her mouth Clove unto mine as soul to body doth,       And, laughing, made her lips luxurious; Her hair had smells of all the sunburnt south, Strange spice and flower, strange savour of crushed fruit, And perfume the swart kings tread underfoot       For pleasure when their minds wax amorous, Charred frankincense and grated sandal-root. And I forgot fear and all weary things, All ended prayers and perished thanksgivings,       Feeling her face with all her eager hair Cleave to me, clinging as a fire that clings To the body and to the raiment, burning them; As after death I know that such-like flame       Shall cleave to me for ever; yea, what care, Albeit I burn then, having felt the same? Ah love, there is no better life than this; To have known love, how bitter a thing it is,       And afterward be cast out of God's sight; Yea, these that know not, shall they have such bliss High up in barren heaven before his face As we twain in the heavy-hearted place,       Remembering love and all the dead delight, And all that time was sweet with for a space? For till the thunder in the trumpet be, Soul may divide from body, but not we       One from another; I hold thee with my hand, I let mine eyes have all their will of thee, I seal myself upon thee with my might, Abiding alway out of all men's sight       Until God loosen over sea and land The thunder of the trumpets of the night.

 For those whom others ban.I think before His great white throne,
 His throne of spotless light,That whited sepulchres shall wear
 The hue of endless night.That I who fell, and he who sinned,
 Shall reap as we have sown;That each the burden of his loss
 Must bear and bear alone.No golden weights can turn the scale
 Of justice in His sight;And what is wrong in woman’s life
 In man’s cannot be right.

She pays attention to the hair, not her fingers, and cuts herself  once or twice a day.   Doesn’t notice anymore, just if the blood  starts flowing.   Says, Excuse me, to the customer and walks away  for a band-aid.   Same spot on the middle finger over and over,  raised like a callus.   Also the nicks where she snips between  her fingers, the torn webbing.   Also spider veins on her legs now,  so ugly, though she sits in a chair for half of each cut, rolls around  from side to side.   At night in the winter she sleeps in white  cotton gloves, Neosporin on the cuts, vitamin E, then heavy  lotion.   All night, for weeks, her white hands lie clothed like  those of a young girl going to her first party.   Sleeping alone,  she opens and closes her long scissors and the hair falls under  her hands.   It’s a good living, kind of like an undertaker,  the people keep coming, and the hair, shoulder length, French  twist, braids.   Someone has to cut it.   At the end she whisks  and talcums my neck.

It is true also that we here are Americans:
That we use the machines: that a sight of the god is unusual:
That more people have more thoughts: that there are
Progress and science and tractors and revolutions and
Marx and the wars more antiseptic and murderous
And music in every home: there is also Hoover.

Known vocation following troops: they must sleep with
Stragglers from either prince and of both views.
The rules permit them to further the business of neither.
It is also strictly forbidden to mix in maneuvers.
Those that infringe are inflated with praise on the plazas—
Their bones are resultantly afterwards found under newspapers.
Preferring life with the sons to death with the fathers,

Will still be shouting around with the same huzzas—

Well fed: the earth’s one: life’s

Wrap the bard in a flag or a school and they’ll jimmy his
Door down and be thick in his bed—for a month:
(Who recalls the address now of the Imagists?)
But the naked man has always his own nakedness.
People remember forever his live limbs.
They may drive him out of the camps but one will take him.
They may stop his tongue on his teeth with a rope’s argument—
He will lie in a house and be warm when they are shaking.
Besides, Tovarishch, how to embrace an army?
How to take to one’s chamber a million souls?
How to conceive in the name of a column of marchers?
The things of the poet are done to a man alone
As the things of love are done—or of death when he hears the
Step withdraw on the stair and the clock tick only.
Neither his class nor his kind nor his trade may come near him
There where he lies on his left arm and will die,
Nor his class nor his kind nor his trade when the blood is jeering
And his knee’s in the soft of the bed where his love lies.

A hardy life with a boot as quick as a fiver:

To sing of Wars, of Captains, and of Kings, Of Cities founded, Common-wealths begun, For my mean Pen are too superior things; Or how they all, or each their dates have run, Let Poets and Historians set these forth. My obscure lines shall not so dim their worth. But when my wond’ring eyes and envious heart Great Bartas’ sugar’d lines do but read o’er, Fool, I do grudge the Muses did not part ‘Twixt him and me that over-fluent store. A Bartas can do what a Bartas will But simple I according to my skill. From School-boy’s tongue no Rhet’ric we expect, Nor yet a sweet Consort from broken strings, Nor perfect beauty where’s a main defect. My foolish, broken, blemished Muse so sings, And this to mend, alas, no Art is able, ‘Cause Nature made it so irreparable. Nor can I, like that fluent sweet-tongued Greek Who lisp’d at first, in future times speak plain. By Art he gladly found what he did seek, A full requital of his striving pain. Art can do much, but this maxim’s most sure: A weak or wounded brain admits no cure. I am obnoxious to each carping tongue Who says my hand a needle better fits. A Poet’s Pen all scorn I should thus wrong, For such despite they cast on female wits. If what I do prove well, it won’t advance, They’ll say it’s stol’n, or else it was by chance. But sure the antique Greeks were far more mild, Else of our Sex, why feigned they those nine And poesy made Calliope’s own child? So ‘mongst the rest they placed the Arts divine, But this weak knot they will full soon untie. The Greeks did nought but play the fools and lie. Let Greeks be Greeks, and Women what they are. Men have precedency and still excel; It is but vain unjustly to wage war. Men can do best, and Women know it well. Preeminence in all and each is yours; Yet grant some small acknowledgement of ours. And oh ye high flown quills that soar the skies, And ever with your prey still catch your praise, If e’er you deign these lowly lines your eyes, Give thyme or Parsley wreath, I ask no Bays. This mean and unrefined ore of mine Will make your glist’ring gold but more to shine.

He had forgotten something in the house.
Motionless he eyes the room that glows

This way and that. Soft are the beasts of light

Upon the whiteness. How like a water-plant
It floats upon the black canal of sleep,
Suspended upward from the distant deep
In pure achievement of its lovely want!
Quietly then he plucks it and it folds
And is again a hand, small as a child’s.
He would revive it but it barely stirs
And so he carries it off a little way
And breaks it open gently. Now he can see
The sweetness of the fruit, his hand eats hers.

No woman wants to be low-hanging fruit,
my glamorous girlfriend says, but I’m indiscriminate
and love all fruit, I’m tempted to list each kind
right here, in and out of season,
because even just saying the names gives me pleasure,
as does saying your name.
I’m not alone with my passion — my whole family,
we’re a little off in this regard,
we can spend hours talking about cantaloupe
or arguing over how many flats to buy
when it’s Peach-O-Rama at the Metropolitan.
Once I even drove half a day to get to Pence Orchards

He was so good to me, as was the late-summer freestone

On the contrary, I was in heaven there in Yakima.
I can still smell that single peach, which was profusely
low-hanging, it was the definition of low-hanging,

or perhaps as I did into yours —

In the cubbyhole entrance to Cornell and Son,
a woman in a turquoise sweater
curls up to sleep. Her right arm seeks
a cold spot in the stone to release its worry
and her legs stretch
against the middle hinge.
I want to ask her in for coffee,
to tell her go sleep in the extra bed upstairs,
but I’m a guest,
unaccustomed to this place
where homeless people drift along the square
bordering Benjamin Franklin Parkway.
From her portrait on the mantel,
Lucretia Mott asks when
will Americans see
how all forms of oppression blight
the possibilities of a people.
The passion for preserving Independence Square
should reach this nameless woman, settling
in the heavy heat of August,
exposed to the glare of every passerby.
What makes property so private? A fence?
No trespassing signs? Militia ready to die for it
and taxes? Lights in the middle storeys
of office buildings blaze all night above me.
Newspapers don’t explain how wealth
is bound to these broken people.
North of here, things get really rough.
Longshoremen out of work bet on eddies
in the Schuylkill River.
Factories collapse to weed
and ruptured dream. Years ago, Longhouse sachems
rode canoes to Philadelphia,
entering these red brick halls.
They explained how
the law that kept them unified
required a way to share the wealth.
Inside the hearths of these same halls,
such knowledge was obscured,
and plans were laid to push all Indians ,
west. This city born of brotherly love
still turns around this conflict.

Every fifteen minutes
a patrol car cruises by. I jolt awake
at four a.m. to sirens screeching
and choppers lugging to the hospital heliport
someone who wants to breathe.
The sultry heat leads me
to the window. What matters? This small
square of night sky and two trees
bound by a wide brick wall.
All around, skyscrapers
are telling their stories
under dwindling stars. The girders
remember where Mohawk ironworkers stayed
that day they sat after work
on a balcony, drinking beer.
Below them, a film crew caught
some commercials. In another room above
a mattress caught fire and someone flung it
down into the frame. A woman in blue
sashayed up the street
while a flaming mattress,
falling at the same speed as a flower,
bloomed over her left shoulder.
Every fifteen minutes
a patrol car cruises by. The men inside
mean business. They understood the scene.
A mattress burning in the street
and business deadlocked. Mohawks
drinking beer above it all.
They radioed insurrection,
drew their guns, then three-stepped
up the stairs. Film crews caught the scene,
but it never played. The Mohawks
didn’t guess a swat team had moved in.
When policemen blasted off their door,
the terrified men shoved a table
against the splintered frame.
They fought it out.
One whose name meant Deer got shot
again and again. They let him lie
before they dragged him by his heels
down four flights of stairs. At every step,
he hurdled above his pain
until one final leap
gained him the stars.
The news reported one cop broke his leg.
The film’s been banished to a vault. There are
no plaques. But girders whisper at night
in Philadelphia. They know the boarding house,
but will not say. They know as well what lasts
      and what falls down.III
Passing Doric colonnades of banks
and walls of dark glass,
passing press-the-button-visitors-please
Liberty Townhouses, I turned
up Broad Street near the Hershey Hotel
and headed toward the doorman
outside the Bellevue. Palms and chandeliers inside.
A woman in mauve silk and pearls stepped into the street.
I was tracking my Mohawk grandmother
through time. She left a trace
of her belief somewhere near Locust and Thirteenth.
I didn’t see you, tall, dark, intense,
with three bouquets of flowers in your hand.
On Walnut and Broad, between the Union League
and the Indian Campsite, you stopped me,
shoving flowers toward my arm.
“At least, I’m not begging,” you cried.
The desperation in your voice
spiraled through my feet while I fumbled the few bucks
you asked for. I wanted those flowers—
iris, ageratum, goldenrod and lilies—
because in desperation
you thought of beauty. I recognized
the truth and human love you acted on,
your despair echoing my own.
Forgive me. I should have bought more
of those Philadelphia flowers, passed hand
to hand so quickly, I was stunned a block away.
You had to keep your pride, as I have done,
selling these bouquets of poems
to anyone who’ll take them. After our exchange,
grandmother’s tracks grew clearer.
I returned for days, but you were never there.
If you see her — small, dark, intense,
with a bun of black hair and the gaze of an orphan,
leave a petal in my path.
Then I’ll know I can go on.IV
Some days you get angry enough
to question. There’s a plan out east
with a multitude of charts and diagrams.
They planned to take the timber, the good soil.
Even now, they demolish mountains.
Next they’ll want the water and the air.
I tell you they’re planning to leave our reservations
bare of life. They plan to dump their toxic

I
Again the native hour lets down the locks   
Uncombed and black, but gray the bobbing beard;   
Ten years ago His eyes, fierce shuttlecocks,   
Pierced the close net of what I failed: I feared   
The belly-cold, the grave-clout, that betrayed   
Me dithering in the drift of cordial seas;
Ten years are time enough to be dismayed
By mummy Christ, head crammed between his knees.   
Suppose I take an arrogant bomber, stroke   
By stroke, up to the frazzled sun to hear   
Sun-ghostlings whisper: Yes, the capital yoke—
Remove it and there’s not a ghost to fear   
This crucial day, whose decapitate joke   
Languidly winds into the inner ear.II
The day’s at end and there’s nowhere to go,   
Draw to the fire, even this fire is dying;   
Get up and once again politely lying
Invite the ladies toward the mistletoe
With greedy eyes that stare like an old crow.   
How pleasantly the holly wreaths did hang   
And how stuffed Santa did his reindeer clang   
Above the golden oaken mantel, years ago!
Then hang this picture for a calendar,
As sheep for goat, and pray most fixedly   
For the cold martial progress of your star,   
With thoughts of commerce and society,   
Well-milked Chinese, Negroes who cannot sing,   
The Huns gelded and feeding in a ring.III
Give me this day a faith not personal
As follows: The American people fully armed   
With assurance policies, righteous and harmed,   
Battle the world of which they’re not at all.   
That lying boy of ten who stood in the hall,   
His hat in hand (thus by his father charmed:   
“You may be President”), was not alarmed   
Nor even left uneasy by his fall.
Nobody said that he could be a plumber,   
Carpenter, clerk, bus-driver, bombardier;   
Let little boys go into violent slumber,   
Aegean squall and squalor where their fear   
Is of an enemy in remote oceans
Unstalked by Christ: these are the better notions.IV
Gay citizen, myself, and thoughtful friend,   
Your ghosts are Plato’s Christians in the cave.   
Unfix your necks, turn to the door; the nave   
Gives back the cheated and light dividend
So long sequestered; now, new-rich, you’ll spend   
Flesh for reality inside a stone
Whose light obstruction, like a gossamer bone,   
Dead or still living, will not break or bend.
Thus light, your flesh made pale and sinister   
And put off like a dog that’s had his day,   
You will be Plato’s kept philosopher,
Albino man bleached from the mortal clay,   
Mild-mannered, gifted in your master’s ease   
While the sun squats upon the waveless seas.

The job was easy: I tucked
them in, kicked off my shoes, listened for
the floor to go quiet. Everyone
slept except one: outside her door,
she paced, she hummed, holding
the edge of her torn
nightgown. Pointing, I told
her: to bed. Your bed. But she would not
stay there. She was old,
older than my mother: manic, caught
up in gibberish, determined to
sleep on my cot—
At first it was just to
quiet her. I could only sleep
if she slept, and I needed relief
from myself. That is how she
became a body next to mine
whether or not I wanted there to be
a body. She climbed
into my bed. I let her
sleep hot and damp against my spine.
All night she rocked, she turned,
she poked her spastic elbows
into my calves and slurred
her broken noises in the dark. All the old
fans went round in clicks
those summer nights—and she rolled
in bed and kicked
me in the head and I was
happy. No words, no tricks,
I just didn't love
my loneliness. My mind
felt cooler
with her there. Beside
her, I could have been anyone.
She had no word for me and not the kind
of mind to keep one.
And if she kicked
me, some nights, just
for the fun of it—who was I
to disappoint my one?
Sometimes I imagine I
was someone she won
at a fair as the wheel spun
under the floating, unfaltering sun
and clicked each lucky one
and one
until I was happily undone.

                    The Desk
                ","
Under the fire escape, crouched, one knee in cinders,   
I pulled the ball-peen hammer from my belt,   
cracked a square of window pane,
the gummed latch, and swung the window,
crawled through that stone hole into the boiler room   
of Canton Elementary School, once Canton High,   
where my father served three extra years   
as star halfback and sprinter.
Behind a flashlight’s
cane of light, I climbed a staircase almost a ladder
and found a door. On the second nudge of my shoulder,
it broke into a hallway dark as history,
at whose end lay the classroom I had studied   
over and over in the deep obsession of memory.
I swept that room with my light—an empty blackboard,
a metal table, a half-globe lying on the floor   
like a punctured basketball—then followed   
that beam across the rows of desks,
the various catalogs of lovers, the lists
of all those who would and would not do what,   
until it stopped on the corner desk of the back row,   
and I saw again, after many years the name
of my father, my name, carved deep into the oak top.
To gauge the depth I ran my finger across that scar,   
and wondered at the dreams he must have lived   
as his eyes ran back and forth
from the cinder yard below the window
to the empty practice field
to the blade of his pocket knife etching carefully   
the long, angular lines of his name,
the dreams he must have laid out one behind another   
like yard lines, in the dull, pre-practice afternoons   
of geography and civics, before he ever dreamed
of Savo Sound or Guadalcanal.
                                             In honor of dreams
I sank to my knees on the smooth, oiled floor,   
and stood my flashlight on its end.
Half the yellow circle lit the underedge of the desk,   
the other threw a half-moon on the ceiling,   
and in that split light I tapped the hammer
easy up the overhang of the desk top. Nothing gave   
but the walls’ sharp echo, so I swung again,   
and again harder, and harder still in half anger   
rising to anger at the stubborn joint, losing all fear   
of my first crime against the city, the county,   
the state, whatever government claimed dominion,   
until I had hammered up in the ringing dark   
a salvo of crossfire, and on a frantic recoil glanced   
the flashlight, the classroom spinning black   
as a coma.
               I’ve often pictured the face of the teacher   
whose student first pointed to that topless desk,   
the shock of a slow hand rising from the back row,   
their eyes meeting over the question of absence.
I’ve wondered too if some low authority of the system   
discovered that shattered window,
and finding no typewriters, no business machines,   
no audiovisual gear missing, failed to account for it,   
so let it pass as minor vandalism.
                                                               I’ve heard nothing.
And rarely do I fret when I see that oak scar leaning   
against my basement wall, though I wonder what it means   
to own my father’s name.

Before the unseen cock had called the time,
     Those workers left their beds and stumbled out
Into the street, where dust lay white as lime

Then blinking still from bed, they trod the street,
     The doors closed up and down ;  the traveller heard
Doors opened, closed, then silence, then men’s feet
     Moving to toil, the men too drowsed for word.
The bean-field was a greyness as they passed,
     The darkness of the hedge was starred with flowers,
The moth, with wings like dead leaves, sucked his last,
     The triumphing cock cried out with all his powers ;
His fire of crying made the twilight quick,
Then clink, clink, clink, men’s trowels tapped the brick.
 
I saw the delicate man who built the tower
     Look from the turret at the ground below,
The granite column wavered like a flower,
     But stood in air whatever winds might blow.
Its roots were in the rock, its head stood proud,
     No earthly forest reared a head so high ;
Sometimes the eagle came there, sometimes cloud,
     It was man’s ultimate footstep to the sky.
And in that peak the builder kept his treasure,
     Books with the symbols of his art, the signs
Of knowledge in excitement, skill in pleasure,
     The edge that cut, the rule that kept the lines.
He who had seen his tower beneath the grass,
Rock in the earth, now smiled, because it was.
 
How many thousand men had done his will,  
     Men who had hands, or arms, or strength to spend,
Or cunning with machines, or art, or skill !
     All had obeyed him, working to this end.      
Hundreds in distant lands had given their share
     Of power, to deck it ;  on its every stone
Their oddity of pleasure was laid bare,
     Yet was the tower his offspring, his alone.
His inner eye had seen, his will had made it,
     All the opposing army of men’s minds
Had bowed, had turned, had striven as he bade it,
     Each to his purpose in their myriad kinds.
Now it was done, and in the peak he stood
Seeing his work, and smiled to find it good.
 
It had been stone, earth’s body, hidden deep,
     Lightless and shapeless, where it cooled and hardened.
Now it was as the banner on man’s keep
     Or as the Apple in Eden where God gardened.
Lilies of stone ran round it, and like fires
     The tongues of crockets shot from it and paused,
Horsemen who raced were carven on’t, the spires
     Were bright with gold ;  all this the builder caused.
And standing there, it seemed that all the hive
     Of human skill which now it had become,
Was stone no more, nor building, but alive,
     Trying to speak, this tower that was dumb,
 Trying to speak, nay, speaking, soul to soul
With powers who are, to raven or control

MEan while the new-baptiz'd, who yet remain'd At Jordan with the Baptist, and had seen Him whom they heard so late expresly call'd Jesus Messiah Son of God declar'd, And on that high Authority had believ'd, And with him talkt, and with him lodg'd, I mean Andrew and Simon, famous after known With others though in Holy Writ not nam'd, Now missing him thir joy so lately found, So lately found, and so abruptly gone, Began to doubt, and doubted many days, And as the days increas'd, increas'd thir doubt: Sometimes they thought he might be only shewn, And for a time caught up to God, as once Moses was in the Mount, and missing long; And the great Thisbite who on fiery wheels Rode up to Heaven, yet once again to come. Therefore as those young Prophets then with care Sought lost Eliah, so in each place these Nigh to Bethabara; in Jerico The City of Palms, Ænon, and Salem Old, Machærus and each Town or City wall'd On this side the broad lake Genezaret, Or in Perea, but return'd in vain. Then on the bank of Jordan, by a Creek: Where winds with Reeds, and Osiers whisp'ring play Plain Fishermen, no greater men them call, Close in a Cottage low together got Thir unexpected loss and plaints out breath'd. Alas, from what high hope to what relapse Unlook'd for are we fall'n, our eyes beheld Messiah certainly now come, so long Expected of our Fathers; we have heard His words, his wisdom full of grace and truth, Now, now, for sure, deliverance is at hand, The Kingdom shall to Israel be restor'd: Thus we rejoyc'd, but soon our joy is turn'd Into perplexity and new amaze: For whither is he gone, what accident Hath rapt him from us? will he now retire After appearance, and again prolong Our expectation?   God of Israel, Send thy Messiah forth, the time is come; Behold the Kings of the Earth how they oppress Thy chosen, to what highth thir pow'r unjust They have exalted, and behind them cast All fear of thee, arise and vindicate Thy Glory, free thy people from thir yoke, But let us wait; thus far he hath perform'd, Sent his Anointed, and to us reveal'd him, By his great Prophet, pointed at and shown, In publick, and with him we have convers'd; Let us be glad of this, and all our fears Lay on his Providence; he will not fail Nor will withdraw him now, nor will recall, Mock us with his blest sight, then snatch him hence, Soon we shall see our hope, our joy return.    Thus they out of their plaints new hope resume To find whom at the first they found unsought: But to his Mother Mary, when she saw Others return'd from Baptism, not her Son, Nor left at Jordan, tydings of him none; Within her brest, though calm; her brest though pure, Motherly cares and fears got head, and rais'd Some troubl'd thoughts, which she in sighs thus clad.    O what avails me now that honour high To have conceiv'd of God, or that salute Hale highly favour'd, among women blest; While I to sorrows am no less advanc't, And fears as eminent, above the lot Of other women, by the birth I bore, In such a season born when scarce a Shed Could be obtain'd to shelter him or me From the bleak air; a Stable was our warmth, A Manger his, yet soon enforc't to flye Thence into Egypt, till the Murd'rous King Were dead, who sought his life, and missing fill'd With Infant blood the streets of Bethlehem; From Egypt home return'd, in Nazareth Hath been our dwelling many years, his life Private, unactive, calm, contemplative, Little suspicious to any King; but now Full grown to Man, acknowledg'd, as I hear, By John the Baptist, and in publick shown, Son own'd from Heaven by his Father's voice; I look't for some great change; to Honour? no, But trouble, as old Simeon plain fore-told, That to the fall and rising he should be Of many in Israel, and to a sign Spoken against, that through my very Soul A sword shall pierce, this is my favour'd lot, My Exaltation to Afflictions high; Afflicted I may be, it seems, and blest; I will not argue that, nor will repine. But where delays he now? some great intent Conceals him: when twelve years he scarce had seen, I lost him, but so found, as well I saw He could not lose himself; but went about His Father's business; what he meant I mus'd, Since understand; much more his absence now Thus long to some great purpose he obscures. But I to wait with patience am inur'd; My heart hath been a store-house long of things And sayings laid up, portending strange events.    Thus Mary pondering oft, and oft to mind Recalling what remarkably had pass'd Since first her Salutation heard, with thoughts Meekly compos'd awaited the fulfilling: The while her Son tracing the Desert wild, Sole but with holiest Meditations fed, Into himself descended, and at once All his great work to come before him set; How to begin, how to accomplish best His end of being on Earth, and mission high: For Satan with slye preface to return Had left him vacant, and with speed was gon Up to the middle Region of thick Air, Where all his Potentates in Council sate; There without sign of boast, or sign of joy, Sollicitous and blank he thus began.    Princes, Heavens antient Sons, Æthereal Thrones, Demonian Spirits now, from the Element Each of his reign allotted, rightlier call'd, Powers of Fire, Air, Water, and Earth beneath, So may we hold our place and these mild seats Without new trouble; such an Enemy Is ris'n to invade us, who no less Threat'ns then our expulsion down to Hell; I, as I undertook, and with the vote Consenting in full frequence was impowr'd, Have found him, view'd him, tasted him, but find Far other labour to be undergon Then when I dealt with Adam first of Men, Though Adam by his Wives allurement fell, However to this Man inferior far, If he be Man by Mothers side at least, With more then humane gifts from Heaven adorn'd, Perfections absolute, Graces divine, And amplitude of mind to greatest Deeds. Therefore I am return'd, lest confidence Of my success with Eve in Paradise Deceive ye to perswasion over-sure Of like succeeding here; I summon all Rather to be in readiness, with hand Or counsel to assist; lest I who erst Thought none my equal, now be over-match'd.    So spake the old Serpent doubting, and from all With clamour was assur'd thir utmost aid At his command; when from amidst them rose Belial the dissolutest Spirit that fell, The sensuallest, and after Asmodai The fleshliest Incubus, and thus advis'd.    Set women in his eye and in his walk, Among daughters of men the fairest found; Many are in each Region passing fair As the noon Skie; more like to Goddesses Then Mortal Creatures, graceful and discreet, Expert in amorous Arts, enchanting tongues Perswasive, Virgin majesty with mild And sweet allay'd, yet terrible to approach, Skill'd to retire, and in retiring draw Hearts after them tangl'd in Amorous Nets. Such object hath the power to soft'n and tame Severest temper, smooth the rugged'st brow, Enerve, and with voluptuous hope dissolve, Draw out with credulous desire, and lead At will the manliest, resolutest brest, As the Magnetic hardest Iron draws. Women, when nothing else, beguil'd the heart Of wisest Solomon, and made him build, And made him bow to the Gods of his Wives.    To whom quick answer Satan thus return'd. Belial, in much uneven scale thou weigh'st All others by thy self; because of old Thou thy self doat'st on womankind, admiring Thir shape, thir colour, and attractive grace, None are, thou think'st, but taken with such toys. Before the Flood thou with thy lusty Crew, False titl'd Sons of God, roaming the Earth Cast wanton eyes on the daughters of men, And coupl'd with them, and begot a race. Have we not seen, or by relation heard, In Courts and Regal Chambers how thou lurk'st, In Wood or Grove by mossie Fountain side, In Valley or Green Meadow to way-lay Some beauty rare, Calisto, Clymene, Daphne, or Semele, Antiopa, Or Amymone, Syrinx, many more Too long, then lay'st thy scapes on names ador'd, Apollo, Neptune, Jupiter, or Pan, Satyr, or Fawn, or Silvan?   But these haunts Delight not all; among the Sons of Men, How many have with a smile made small account Of beauty and her lures, easily scorn'd All her assaults, on worthier things intent? Remember that Pellean Conquerour, A youth, how all the Beauties of the East He slightly view'd, and slightly over-pass'd; How hee sirnam'd of Africa dismiss'd In his prime youth the fair Iberian maid. For Solomon he liv'd at ease, and full Of honour, wealth, high fare, aim'd not beyond Higher design then to enjoy his State; Thence to the bait of Women lay expos'd; But he whom we attempt is wiser far Then Solomon, of more exalted mind, Made and set wholly on the accomplishment Of greatest things; what woman will you find, Though of this Age the wonder and the fame, On whom his leisure will vouchsafe an eye Of fond desire? or should she confident, As sitting Queen ador'd on Beauties Throne, Descend with all her winning charms begirt To enamour, as the Zone of Venus once Wrought that effect on Jove, so Fables tell; How would one look from his Majestick brow Seated as on the top of Vertues hill, Discount'nance her despis'd, and put to rout All her array; her female pride deject, Or turn to reverent awe? for Beauty stands In the admiration only of weak minds Led captive; cease to admire, and all her Plumes Fall flat and shrink into a trivial toy, At every sudden slighting quite abasht: Therefore with manlier objects we must try His constancy, with such as have more shew Of worth, of honour, glory, and popular praise; Rocks whereon greatest men have oftest wreck'd; Or that which only seems to satisfie Lawful desires of Nature, not beyond; And now I know he hungers where no food Is to be found, in the wide Wilderness; The rest commit to me, I shall let pass No advantage, and his strength as oft assay.    He ceas'd, and heard thir grant in loud acclaim; Then forthwith to him takes a chosen band Of Spirits likest to himself in guile To be at hand, and at his beck appear, If cause were to unfold some active Scene Of various persons each to know his part; Then to the Desert takes with these his flight; Where still from shade to shade the Son of God After forty days fasting had remain'd, Now hungring first, and to himself thus said.    Where will this end? four times ten days I have pass'd Wandring this woody maze, and humane food Nor tasted, nor had appetite; that Fast To Vertue I impute not, or count part Of what I suffer here; if Nature need not, Or God support Nature without repast Though needing, what praise is it to endure? But now I feel I hunger, which declares, Nature hath need of what she asks; yet God Can satisfie that need some other way, Though hunger still remain: so it remain Without this bodies wasting, I content me, And from the sting of Famine fear no harm, Nor mind it, fed with better thoughts that feed Mee hungring more to do my Fathers will.    It was the hour of night, when thus the Son Commun'd in silent walk, then laid him down Under the hospitable covert nigh Of Trees thick interwoven; there he slept, And dream'd, as appetite is wont to dream, Of meats and drinks, Natures refreshment sweet; Him thought, he by the Brook of Cherith stood And saw the Ravens with their horny beaks Food to Elijah bringing Even and Morn, Though ravenous, taught to abstain from what they brought: He saw the Prophet also how he fled Into the Desert, and how there he slept Under a Juniper; then how awakt, He found his Supper on the coals prepar'd, And by the Angel was bid rise and eat, And eat the second time after repose, The strength whereof suffic'd him forty days; Sometimes that with Elijah he partook, Or as a guest with Daniel at his pulse. Thus wore out night, and now the Herald Lark Left his ground-nest, high towring to descry The morns approach, and greet her with his Song: As lightly from his grassy Couch up rose Our Saviour, and found all was but a dream, Fasting he went to sleep, and fasting wak'd. Up to a hill anon his steps he rear'd, From whose high top to ken the prospect round, If Cottage were in view, Sheep-cote or Herd; But Cottage, Herd or Sheep-cote none he saw, Only in a bottom saw a pleasant Grove, With chaunt of tuneful Birds resounding loud; Thither he bent his way, determin'd there To rest at noon, and entr'd soon the shade High rooft and walks beneath, and alleys brown That open'd in the midst a woody Scene, Natures own work it seem'd (Nature taught Art) And to a Superstitious eye the haunt Of Wood-Gods and Wood-Nymphs; he view'd it round, When suddenly a man before him stood, Not rustic as before, but seemlier clad, As one in City, or Court, or Palace bred, And with fair speech these words to him address'd.    With granted leave officious I return, But much more wonder that the Son of God In this wild solitude so long should bide Of all things destitute, and well I know, Not without hunger.   Others of some note, As story tells, have trod this Wilderness; The Fugitive Bond-woman with her Son Out cast Nebaioth, yet found he relief By a providing Angel; all the race Of Israel here had famish'd, had not God Rain'd from Heaven Manna, and that Prophet bold Native of Thebes wandring here was fed Twice by a voice inviting him to eat. Of thee these forty days none hath regard, Forty and more deserted here indeed.    To whom thus Jesus; what conclud'st thou hence? They all had need, I as thou seest have none.    How hast thou hunger then? Satan reply'd, Tell me if Food were now before thee set, Would'st thou not eat? Thereafter as I like The giver, answer'd Jesus. Why should that Cause thy refusal, said the subtle Fiend, Hast thou not right to all Created things, Owe not all Creatures by just right to thee Duty and Service, nor to stay till bid, But tender all their power? nor mention I Meats by the Law unclean, or offer'd first To Idols, those young Daniel could refuse; Nor proffer'd by an Enemy, though who Would scruple that, with want opprest? behold Nature asham'd, or better to express, Troubl'd that thou shouldst hunger, hath purvey'd From all the Elements her choicest store To treat thee as beseems, and as her Lord With honour, only deign to sit and eat.    He spake no dream, for as his words had end, Our Saviour lifting up his eyes beheld In ample space under the broadest shade A Table richly spred, in regal mode, With dishes pill'd, and meats of noblest sort And savour, Beasts of chase, or Fowl of game, In pastry built, or from the spit, or boyl'd, Gris-amber-steam'd; all Fish from Sea or Shore, Freshet, or purling Brook, of shell or fin, And exquisitest name, for which was drain'd Pontus and Lucrine Bay, and Afric Coast. Alas how simple, to these Cates compar'd, Was that crude Apple that diverted Eve! And at a stately side-board by the wine That fragrant smell diffus'd, in order stood Tall stripling youths rich clad, of fairer hew Then Ganymed or Hylas, distant more Under the Trees now trip'd, now solemn stood Nymphs of Diana's train, and Naiades With fruits and flowers from Amalthea's horn, And Ladies of th' Hesperides, that seem'd Fairer then feign'd of old, or fabl'd since Of Fairy Damsels met in Forest wide By Knights of Logres, or of Lyones, Lancelot or Pelleas, or Pellenore, And all the while Harmonious Airs were heard Of chiming strings, or charming pipes and winds Of gentlest gale Arabian odors fann'd From their soft wings, and Flora's earliest smells. Such was the Splendour, and the Tempter now His invitation earnestly renew'd.    What doubts the Son of God to sit and eat? These are not Fruits forbidden, no interdict Defends the touching of these viands pure, Thir taste no knowledge works, at least of evil, But life preserves, destroys life's enemy, Hunger, with sweet restorative delight. All these are Spirits of Air, and Woods, and Springs, Thy gentle Ministers, who come to pay Thee homage, and acknowledge thee thir Lord: What doubt'st thou Son of God? sit down and eat.    To whom thus Jesus temperately reply'd: Said'st thou not that to all things I had right? And who withholds my pow'r that right to use? Shall I receive by gift what of my own, When and where likes me best, I can command? I can at will, doubt not, as soon as thou, Command a Table in this Wilderness, And call swift flights of Angels ministrant Array'd in Glory on my cup to attend: Why shouldst thou then obtrude this diligence, In vain, where no acceptance it can find, And with my hunger what has thou to do? Thy pompous Delicacies I contemn, And count thy specious gifts no gifts but guiles.    To whom thus answer'd Satan malecontent: That I have also power to give thou seest, If of that pow'r I bring thee voluntary What I might have bestow'd on whom I pleas'd, And rather opportunely in this place Chose to impart to thy apparent need, Why shouldst thou not accept it? but I see What I can do or offer is suspect; Of these things others quickly will dispose Whose pains have earn'd the far fet spoil. With that Both Table and Provision vanish'd quite With sound of Harpies wings, and Talons heard; Only the importune Tempter still remain'd, And with these words his temptation pursu'd.    By hunger, that each other Creature tames, Thou art not to be harm'd, therefore not mov'd; Thy temperance invincible besides, For no allurement yields to appetite, And all thy heart is set on high designs, High actions; but wherewith to be atchiev'd? Great acts require great means of enterprise, Thou art unknown, unfriended, low of birth, A Carpenter thy Father known, thy self Bred up in poverty and streights at home; Lost in a Desert here and hunger-bit: Which way or from what hope dost thou aspire To greatness? whence Authority deriv'st, What Followers, what Retinue canst thou gain, Or at thy heels the dizzy Multitude, Longer then thou canst feed them on thy cost? Money brings Honour, Friends, Conquest, and Realms; What rais'd Antipater the Edomite, And his Son Herod plac'd on Juda's Throne; (Thy throne) but gold that got him puissant friends? Therefore, if at great things thou wouldst arrive, Get Riches first, get Wealth, and Treasure heap, Not difficult, if thou hearken to me, Riches are mine, Fortune is in my hand; They whom I favour thrive in wealth amain, While Virtue, Valour, Wisdom sit in want.    To whom thus Jesus patiently reply'd; Yet Wealth without these three is impotent, To gain dominion or to keep it gain'd. Witness those antient Empires of the Earth, In highth of all thir flowing wealth dissolv'd: But men endu'd with these have oft attain'd In lowest poverty to highest deeds; Gideon and Jephtha, and the Shepherd lad, Whose off-spring on the Throne of Juda sat So many Ages, and shall yet regain That seat, and reign in Israel without end. Among the Heathen, (for throughout the World To me is not unknown what hath been done Worthy of Memorial) canst thou not remember Quintius, Fabricius, Curius, Regulus? For I esteem those names of men so poor Who could do mighty things, and could contemn Riches though offer'd from the hand of Kings. And what in me seems wanting, but that I May also in this poverty as soon Accomplish what they did, perhaps and more? Extol not Riches then, the toyl of Fools, The wise mans cumbrance if not snare, more apt To slacken Virtue, and abate her edge, Then prompt her to do aught may merit praise. What if with like aversion I reject Riches and Realms; yet not for that a Crown, Golden in shew, is but a wreath of thorns, Brings dangers, troubles, cares, and sleepless nights To him who wears the Regal Diadem, When on his shoulders each mans burden lies; For therein stands the office of a King, His Honour, Vertue, Merit and chief Praise, That for the Publick all this weight he bears. Yet he who reigns within himself, and rules Passions, Desires, and Fears, is more a King; Which every wise and vertuous man attains: And who attains not, ill aspires to rule Cities of men or head-strong Multitudes, Subject himself to Anarchy within, Or lawless passions in him which he serves. But to guide Nations in the way of truth By saving Doctrine, and from errour lead To know, and knowing worship God aright, Is yet more Kingly, this attracts the Soul, Governs the inner man, the nobler part, That other o're the body only reigns, And oft by force, which to a generous mind So reigning can be no sincere delight. Besides to give a Kingdom hath been thought Greater and nobler done, and to lay down Far more magnanimous, then to assume. Riches are needless then, both for themselves, And for thy reason why they should be sought, To gain a Scepter, oftest better miss't.

the cold brush of brick, and the smell
of the brick powdery and wet

and are holy that my body is promised
to something more certain

rise and enter a holy house.

Down the street, someone must be praying, and though I don’t
Go there anymore, I want to at times, to hear the diction
And the tone, though the English pronoun for God is obsolete—
What goes on is devotion, which wouldn’t change if I heard:
The polished sermon, the upright’s arpeggios of vacant notes.
What else could unite widows, bankers, children, and ghosts?
And those faces are so good as they tilt their smiles upward
To the rostrum that represents law, and the minister who
Represents God beams like the white palm of the good hand
Of Christ raised behind the baptistry to signal the multitude,
Which I am not among, though I feel the abundance of calm
And know the beatitude so well I do not have to imagine it,
Or the polite old ones who gather after the service to chat,
Or the ritual linen of Sunday tables that are already set.
More than any other days, Sundays stand in unvarying rows
That beg attention: there is that studied verisimilitude
Of sanctuary, so even mud and bitten weeds look dressed up
For some eye in the distant past, some remote kingdom
Where the pastures are crossed by thoroughly symbolic rivers.
That is why the syntax of prayers is so often reversed,
Aimed toward the dead who clearly have not gone ahead
But returned to prior things, a vista of angels and sheep,
A desert where men in robes and sandals gather by a tree.
Hushed stores, all day that sense a bell is about to ring—
I recognized it, waking up, before I weighed the bulk of news
Or saw Saturday night’s cars parked randomly along the curb,
And though I had no prayer, I wanted to offer something
Or ask for something, perhaps out of habit, but as the past
Must always be honored unconsciously, formally, and persists
On this first and singular day, though I think of it as last.

The cave itself is pleasantly austere,                      with little clutter—nothing save   a narrow slab, a threadbare woolen wrap,                         and in the chipped-out recess here   three sooty icons lit by oil lamp.                         Just beyond the dim cave's aperture, a blackened kettle rests among the coals,                       whereby, each afternoon, a grip   of wild greens is boiled to a tender mess.                       The eremite lies prostrate near two books—a gospel and the Syrian's                       collected prose—whose pages turn assisted by a breeze. Besides the thread                       of wood smoke rising from the coals, no other motion takes the eye. The old                         man's face is pressed into the earth, his body stretched as if to reach ahead.                       The pot boils dry. He feeds on what we do not see, and may be satisfied.

At three p.m.
under sky coming to harm
something too red flashes from a limb,
so red it hurts:
against sky coming apart,
against a left-out, twice-soaked shirt,
a cardinal
inflames the profane cathedral
of suburban yard its owner let fall
into disgrace.
How rain embarrasses
the half-pruned hedge. The half-mown grass
that sports a tonsure
in reverse shines under the torture.
Rain slicks with praise red shed, red feather.
Crested seedeater
out of character where
you’re neither the strictly monkish brown thrasher
nor the odd hermit thrush,
you scratch in the underbrush
of faith to see what you can flush:
a grub. A seed.Eminence not grise
but rouge, from your lipsticked beak
you pass a sowbug
to your mate. You peck at a slug
sliming your path, seeming to beg
your forgiveness.
To what would you confess
beyond season-to-season unfaithfulness?
VESPERS
There are more divine hours:
a gold-leafed page a mower
rows with a scythe as tall as the tower
that tents aloft
a tiny sky bereft
of cloud, a chapel ceiling left
unstarred, heaven
a lake turned upside down,
filled with an emptiness that’s clean
because it’s cold,
glacial enough to scald
the skin it bathed, the lungs it filled.
On devotion’s last page,
deep in the golden age
of illumination, the hunt’s cortège
has halted at the edge

in a forest of spears. Red bird the badge

you’re the splash of crimson lake,
the distant lordship’s flag, the cleric
dog’s bright collar,
its heretic tongue. It slavers

And what I assume you shall assume,
For every atom belonging to me as good belongs to you.
I loafe and invite my soul,
I lean and loafe at my ease observing a spear of summer grass.
My tongue, every atom of my blood, form’d from this soil, this air,
Born here of parents born here from parents the same, and their parents the same,
I, now thirty-seven years old in perfect health begin,
Hoping to cease not till death.
Creeds and schools in abeyance,
Retiring back a while sufficed at what they are, but never forgotten,
I harbor for good or bad, I permit to speak at every hazard,
Nature without check with original energy.2
Houses and rooms are full of perfumes, the shelves are crowded with perfumes,
I breathe the fragrance myself and know it and like it,
The distillation would intoxicate me also, but I shall not let it.
The atmosphere is not a perfume, it has no taste of the distillation, it is odorless,
It is for my mouth forever, I am in love with it,
I will go to the bank by the wood and become undisguised and naked,
I am mad for it to be in contact with me.
The smoke of my own breath,
Echoes, ripples, buzz’d whispers, love-root, silk-thread, crotch and vine,
My respiration and inspiration, the beating of my heart, the passing of blood and air through my lungs,
The sniff of green leaves and dry leaves, and of the shore and dark-color’d sea-rocks, and of hay in the barn,
The sound of the belch’d words of my voice loos’d to the eddies of the wind,
A few light kisses, a few embraces, a reaching around of arms,
The play of shine and shade on the trees as the supple boughs wag,
The delight alone or in the rush of the streets, or along the fields and hill-sides,
The feeling of health, the full-noon trill, the song of me rising from bed and meeting the sun.
Have you reckon’d a thousand acres much? have you reckon’d the earth much?
Have you practis’d so long to learn to read?
Have you felt so proud to get at the meaning of poems?
Stop this day and night with me and you shall possess the origin of all poems,
You shall possess the good of the earth and sun, (there are millions of suns left,)
You shall no longer take things at second or third hand, nor look through the eyes of the dead, nor feed on the spectres in books,
You shall not look through my eyes either, nor take things from me,
You shall listen to all sides and filter them from your self.3
I have heard what the talkers were talking, the talk of the beginning and the end,
But I do not talk of the beginning or the end.
There was never any more inception than there is now,
Nor any more youth or age than there is now,
And will never be any more perfection than there is now,
Nor any more heaven or hell than there is now.
Urge and urge and urge,
Always the procreant urge of the world.
Out of the dimness opposite equals advance, always substance and increase, always sex,
Always a knit of identity, always distinction, always a breed of life.
To elaborate is no avail, learn’d and unlearn’d feel that it is so.
Sure as the most certain sure, plumb in the uprights, well entretied, braced in the beams,
Stout as a horse, affectionate, haughty, electrical,
I and this mystery here we stand.
Clear and sweet is my soul, and clear and sweet is all that is not my soul.
Lack one lacks both, and the unseen is proved by the seen,
Till that becomes unseen and receives proof in its turn.
Showing the best and dividing it from the worst age vexes age,
Knowing the perfect fitness and equanimity of things, while they discuss I am silent, and go bathe and admire myself.
Welcome is every organ and attribute of me, and of any man hearty and clean,
Not an inch nor a particle of an inch is vile, and none shall be less familiar than the rest.
I am satisfied—I see, dance, laugh, sing;
As the hugging and loving bed-fellow sleeps at my side through the night, and withdraws at the peep of the day with stealthy tread,
Leaving me baskets cover’d with white towels swelling the house with their plenty,
Shall I postpone my acceptation and realization and scream at my eyes,
That they turn from gazing after and down the road,
And forthwith cipher and show me to a cent,
Exactly the value of one and exactly the value of two, and which is ahead?4
Trippers and askers surround me,
People I meet, the effect upon me of my early life or the ward and city I live in, or the nation,
The latest dates, discoveries, inventions, societies, authors old and new,
My dinner, dress, associates, looks, compliments, dues,
The real or fancied indifference of some man or woman I love,
The sickness of one of my folks or of myself, or ill-doing or loss or lack of money, or depressions or exaltations,
Battles, the horrors of fratricidal war, the fever of doubtful news, the fitful events;
These come to me days and nights and go from me again,
But they are not the Me myself.
Apart from the pulling and hauling stands what I am,
Stands amused, complacent, compassionating, idle, unitary,
Looks down, is erect, or bends an arm on an impalpable certain rest,
Looking with side-curved head curious what will come next,
Both in and out of the game and watching and wondering at it.
Backward I see in my own days where I sweated through fog with linguists and contenders,
I have no mockings or arguments, I witness and wait.5
I believe in you my soul, the other I am must not abase itself to you,
And you must not be abased to the other.
Loafe with me on the grass, loose the stop from your throat,
Not words, not music or rhyme I want, not custom or lecture, not even the best,
Only the lull I like, the hum of your valvèd voice.
I mind how once we lay such a transparent summer morning,
How you settled your head athwart my hips and gently turn’d over upon me,
And parted the shirt from my bosom-bone, and plunged your tongue to my bare-stript heart,
And reach’d till you felt my beard, and reach’d till you held my feet.
Swiftly arose and spread around me the peace and knowledge that pass all the argument of the earth,
And I know that the hand of God is the promise of my own,
And I know that the spirit of God is the brother of my own,
And that all the men ever born are also my brothers, and the women my sisters and lovers,
And that a kelson of the creation is love,
And limitless are leaves stiff or drooping in the fields,
And brown ants in the little wells beneath them,
And mossy scabs of the worm fence, heap’d stones, elder, mullein and poke-weed.6 
A child said What is the grass? fetching it to me with full hands;
How could I answer the child? I do not know what it is any more than he.
I guess it must be the flag of my disposition, out of hopeful green stuff woven.
Or I guess it is the handkerchief of the Lord,
A scented gift and remembrancer designedly dropt,
Bearing the owner’s name someway in the corners, that we may see and remark, and say Whose?
Or I guess the grass is itself a child, the produced babe of the vegetation.
Or I guess it is a uniform hieroglyphic,
And it means, Sprouting alike in broad zones and narrow zones,
Growing among black folks as among white,
Kanuck, Tuckahoe, Congressman, Cuff, I give them the same, I receive them the same.
And now it seems to me the beautiful uncut hair of graves.
Tenderly will I use you curling grass,
It may be you transpire from the breasts of young men,
It may be if I had known them I would have loved them,
It may be you are from old people, or from offspring taken soon out of their mothers’ laps,
And here you are the mothers’ laps.
This grass is very dark to be from the white heads of old mothers,
Darker than the colorless beards of old men,
Dark to come from under the faint red roofs of mouths.
O I perceive after all so many uttering tongues,
And I perceive they do not come from the roofs of mouths for nothing.
I wish I could translate the hints about the dead young men and women,
And the hints about old men and mothers, and the offspring taken soon out of their laps.
What do you think has become of the young and old men?
And what do you think has become of the women and children?
They are alive and well somewhere,
The smallest sprout shows there is really no death,
And if ever there was it led forward life, and does not wait at the end to arrest it,
And ceas’d the moment life appear’d.
All goes onward and outward, nothing collapses,
And to die is different from what any one supposed, and luckier.7
Has any one supposed it lucky to be born?
I hasten to inform him or her it is just as lucky to die, and I know it.
I pass death with the dying and birth with the new-wash’d babe, and am not contain’d between my hat and boots,
And peruse manifold objects, no two alike and every one good,
The earth good and the stars good, and their adjuncts all good.
I am not an earth nor an adjunct of an earth,
I am the mate and companion of people, all just as immortal and fathomless as myself,
(They do not know how immortal, but I know.)
Every kind for itself and its own, for me mine male and female,
For me those that have been boys and that love women,
For me the man that is proud and feels how it stings to be slighted,
For me the sweet-heart and the old maid, for me mothers and the mothers of mothers,
For me lips that have smiled, eyes that have shed tears,
For me children and the begetters of children.
Undrape! you are not guilty to me, nor stale nor discarded,
I see through the broadcloth and gingham whether or no,
And am around, tenacious, acquisitive, tireless, and cannot be shaken away.8
The little one sleeps in its cradle,
I lift the gauze and look a long time, and silently brush away flies with my hand.
The youngster and the red-faced girl turn aside up the bushy hill,
I peeringly view them from the top.
The suicide sprawls on the bloody floor of the bedroom,
I witness the corpse with its dabbled hair, I note where the pistol has fallen.
The blab of the pave, tires of carts, sluff of boot-soles, talk of the promenaders,
The heavy omnibus, the driver with his interrogating thumb, the clank of the shod horses on the granite floor,
The snow-sleighs, clinking, shouted jokes, pelts of snow-balls,
The hurrahs for popular favorites, the fury of rous’d mobs,
The flap of the curtain’d litter, a sick man inside borne to the hospital,
The meeting of enemies, the sudden oath, the blows and fall,
The excited crowd, the policeman with his star quickly working his passage to the centre of the crowd,
The impassive stones that receive and return so many echoes,
What groans of over-fed or half-starv’d who fall sunstruck or in fits,
What exclamations of women taken suddenly who hurry home and give birth to babes,
What living and buried speech is always vibrating here, what howls restrain’d by decorum,
Arrests of criminals, slights, adulterous offers made, acceptances, rejections with convex lips,
I mind them or the show or resonance of them—I come and I depart.9
The big doors of the country barn stand open and ready,
The dried grass of the harvest-time loads the slow-drawn wagon,
The clear light plays on the brown gray and green intertinged,
The armfuls are pack’d to the sagging mow.
I am there, I help, I came stretch’d atop of the load,
I felt its soft jolts, one leg reclined on the other,
I jump from the cross-beams and seize the clover and timothy,
And roll head over heels and tangle my hair full of wisps.10
Alone far in the wilds and mountains I hunt,
Wandering amazed at my own lightness and glee,
In the late afternoon choosing a safe spot to pass the night,
Kindling a fire and broiling the fresh-kill’d game,
Falling asleep on the gather’d leaves with my dog and gun by my side.
The Yankee clipper is under her sky-sails, she cuts the sparkle and scud,
My eyes settle the land, I bend at her prow or shout joyously from the deck.
The boatmen and clam-diggers arose early and stopt for me,
I tuck’d my trowser-ends in my boots and went and had a good time;
You should have been with us that day round the chowder-kettle.
I saw the marriage of the trapper in the open air in the far west, the bride was a red girl,
Her father and his friends sat near cross-legged and dumbly smoking, they had moccasins to their feet and large thick blankets hanging from their shoulders,
On a bank lounged the trapper, he was drest mostly in skins, his luxuriant beard and curls protected his neck, he held his bride by the hand,
She had long eyelashes, her head was bare, her coarse straight locks descended upon her voluptuous limbs and reach’d to her feet.
The runaway slave came to my house and stopt outside,
I heard his motions crackling the twigs of the woodpile,
Through the swung half-door of the kitchen I saw him limpsy and weak,
And went where he sat on a log and led him in and assured him,
And brought water and fill’d a tub for his sweated body and bruis’d feet,
And gave him a room that enter’d from my own, and gave him some coarse clean clothes,
And remember perfectly well his revolving eyes and his awkwardness,
And remember putting plasters on the galls of his neck and ankles;
He staid with me a week before he was recuperated and pass’d north,
I had him sit next me at table, my fire-lock lean’d in the corner.11
Twenty-eight young men bathe by the shore,
Twenty-eight young men and all so friendly;
Twenty-eight years of womanly life and all so lonesome.
She owns the fine house by the rise of the bank,
She hides handsome and richly drest aft the blinds of the window.
Which of the young men does she like the best?
Ah the homeliest of them is beautiful to her.
Where are you off to, lady? for I see you,
You splash in the water there, yet stay stock still in your room.
Dancing and laughing along the beach came the twenty-ninth bather,
The rest did not see her, but she saw them and loved them.
The beards of the young men glisten’d with wet, it ran from their long hair,
Little streams pass’d all over their bodies.
An unseen hand also pass’d over their bodies,
It descended tremblingly from their temples and ribs.
The young men float on their backs, their white bellies bulge to the sun, they do not ask who seizes fast to them,
They do not know who puffs and declines with pendant and bending arch,
They do not think whom they souse with spray.12
The butcher-boy puts off his killing-clothes, or sharpens his knife at the stall in the market,
I loiter enjoying his repartee and his shuffle and break-down.
Blacksmiths with grimed and hairy chests environ the anvil,
Each has his main-sledge, they are all out, there is a great heat in the fire.
From the cinder-strew’d threshold I follow their movements,
The lithe sheer of their waists plays even with their massive arms,
Overhand the hammers swing, overhand so slow, overhand so sure,
They do not hasten, each man hits in his place.13
The negro holds firmly the reins of his four horses, the block swags underneath on its tied-over chain,
The negro that drives the long dray of the stone-yard, steady and tall he stands pois’d on one leg on the string-piece,
His blue shirt exposes his ample neck and breast and loosens over his hip-band,
His glance is calm and commanding, he tosses the slouch of his hat away from his forehead,
The sun falls on his crispy hair and mustache, falls on the black of his polish’d and perfect limbs.
I behold the picturesque giant and love him, and I do not stop there,
I go with the team also.
In me the caresser of life wherever moving, backward as well as forward sluing,
To niches aside and junior bending, not a person or object missing,
Absorbing all to myself and for this song.
Oxen that rattle the yoke and chain or halt in the leafy shade, what is that you express in your eyes?
It seems to me more than all the print I have read in my life.
My tread scares the wood-drake and wood-duck on my distant and day-long ramble,
They rise together, they slowly circle around.
I believe in those wing’d purposes,
And acknowledge red, yellow, white, playing within me,
And consider green and violet and the tufted crown intentional,
And do not call the tortoise unworthy because she is not something else,
And the jay in the woods never studied the gamut, yet trills pretty well to me,
And the look of the bay mare shames silliness out of me.14
The wild gander leads his flock through the cool night,Ya-honk he says, and sounds it down to me like an invitation,
The pert may suppose it meaningless, but I listening close,
Find its purpose and place up there toward the wintry sky.
The sharp-hoof’d moose of the north, the cat on the house-sill, the chickadee, the prairie-dog,
The litter of the grunting sow as they tug at her teats,
The brood of the turkey-hen and she with her half-spread wings,
I see in them and myself the same old law.
The press of my foot to the earth springs a hundred affections,
They scorn the best I can do to relate them.
I am enamour’d of growing out-doors,
Of men that live among cattle or taste of the ocean or woods,
Of the builders and steerers of ships and the wielders of axes and mauls, and the drivers of horses,
I can eat and sleep with them week in and week out.
What is commonest, cheapest, nearest, easiest, is Me,
Me going in for my chances, spending for vast returns,
Adorning myself to bestow myself on the first that will take me,
Not asking the sky to come down to my good will,
Scattering it freely forever.15
The pure contralto sings in the organ loft,
The carpenter dresses his plank, the tongue of his foreplane whistles its wild ascending lisp,
The married and unmarried children ride home to their Thanksgiving dinner,
The pilot seizes the king-pin, he heaves down with a strong arm,
The mate stands braced in the whale-boat, lance and harpoon are ready,
The duck-shooter walks by silent and cautious stretches,
The deacons are ordain’d with cross’d hands at the altar,
The spinning-girl retreats and advances to the hum of the big wheel,
The farmer stops by the bars as he walks on a First-day loafe and looks at the oats and rye,
The lunatic is carried at last to the asylum a confirm’d case,
(He will never sleep any more as he did in the cot in his mother’s bed-room;)
The jour printer with gray head and gaunt jaws works at his case,
He turns his quid of tobacco while his eyes blurr with the manuscript;
The malform’d limbs are tied to the surgeon’s table,
What is removed drops horribly in a pail;
The quadroon girl is sold at the auction-stand, the drunkard nods by the bar-room stove,
The machinist rolls up his sleeves, the policeman travels his beat, the gate-keeper marks who pass,
The young fellow drives the express-wagon, (I love him, though I do not know him;)
The half-breed straps on his light boots to compete in the race,
The western turkey-shooting draws old and young, some lean on their rifles, some sit on logs,
Out from the crowd steps the marksman, takes his position, levels his piece;
The groups of newly-come immigrants cover the wharf or levee,
As the woolly-pates hoe in the sugar-field, the overseer views them from his saddle,
The bugle calls in the ball-room, the gentlemen run for their partners, the dancers bow to each other,
The youth lies awake in the cedar-roof’d garret and harks to the musical rain,
The Wolverine sets traps on the creek that helps fill the Huron,
The squaw wrapt in her yellow-hemm’d cloth is offering moccasins and bead-bags for sale,
The connoisseur peers along the exhibition-gallery with half-shut eyes bent sideways,
As the deck-hands make fast the steamboat the plank is thrown for the shore-going passengers,
The young sister holds out the skein while the elder sister winds it off in a ball, and stops now and then for the knots,
The one-year wife is recovering and happy having a week ago borne her first child,
The clean-hair’d Yankee girl works with her sewing-machine or in the factory or mill,
The paving-man leans on his two-handed rammer, the reporter’s lead flies swiftly over the note-book, the sign-painter is lettering with blue and gold,
The canal boy trots on the tow-path, the book-keeper counts at his desk, the shoemaker waxes his thread,
The conductor beats time for the band and all the performers follow him,
The child is baptized, the convert is making his first professions,
The regatta is spread on the bay, the race is begun, (how the white sails sparkle!)
The drover watching his drove sings out to them that would stray,
The pedler sweats with his pack on his back, (the purchaser higgling about the odd cent;)
The bride unrumples her white dress, the minute-hand of the clock moves slowly,
The opium-eater reclines with rigid head and just-open’d lips,
The prostitute draggles her shawl, her bonnet bobs on her tipsy and pimpled neck,
The crowd laugh at her blackguard oaths, the men jeer and wink to each other,
(Miserable! I do not laugh at your oaths nor jeer you;)
The President holding a cabinet council is surrounded by the great Secretaries,
On the piazza walk three matrons stately and friendly with twined arms,
The crew of the fish-smack pack repeated layers of halibut in the hold,
The Missourian crosses the plains toting his wares and his cattle,
As the fare-collector goes through the train he gives notice by the jingling of loose change,
The floor-men are laying the floor, the tinners are tinning the roof, the masons are calling for mortar,
In single file each shouldering his hod pass onward the laborers;
Seasons pursuing each other the indescribable crowd is gather’d, it is the fourth of Seventh-month, (what salutes of cannon and small arms!)
Seasons pursuing each other the plougher ploughs, the mower mows, and the winter-grain falls in the ground;
Off on the lakes the pike-fisher watches and waits by the hole in the frozen surface,
The stumps stand thick round the clearing, the squatter strikes deep with his axe,
Flatboatmen make fast towards dusk near the cotton-wood or pecan-trees,
Coon-seekers go through the regions of the Red river or through those drain’d by the Tennessee, or through those of the Arkansas,
Torches shine in the dark that hangs on the Chattahooche or Altamahaw,
Patriarchs sit at supper with sons and grandsons and great-grandsons around them,
In walls of adobie, in canvas tents, rest hunters and trappers after their day’s sport,
The city sleeps and the country sleeps,
The living sleep for their time, the dead sleep for their time,
The old husband sleeps by his wife and the young husband sleeps by his wife;
And these tend inward to me, and I tend outward to them,
And such as it is to be of these more or less I am,
And of these one and all I weave the song of myself.16
I am of old and young, of the foolish as much as the wise,
Regardless of others, ever regardful of others,
Maternal as well as paternal, a child as well as a man,
Stuff’d with the stuff that is coarse and stuff’d with the stuff that is fine,
One of the Nation of many nations, the smallest the same and the largest the same,
A Southerner soon as a Northerner, a planter nonchalant and hospitable down by the Oconee I live,
A Yankee bound my own way ready for trade, my joints the limberest joints on earth and the sternest joints on earth,
A Kentuckian walking the vale of the Elkhorn in my deer-skin leggings, a Louisianian or Georgian,
A boatman over lakes or bays or along coasts, a Hoosier, Badger, Buckeye;
At home on Kanadian snow-shoes or up in the bush, or with fishermen off Newfoundland,
At home in the fleet of ice-boats, sailing with the rest and tacking,
At home on the hills of Vermont or in the woods of Maine, or the Texan ranch,
Comrade of Californians, comrade of free North-Westerners, (loving their big proportions,)
Comrade of raftsmen and coalmen, comrade of all who shake hands and welcome to drink and meat,
A learner with the simplest, a teacher of the thoughtfullest,
A novice beginning yet experient of myriads of seasons,
Of every hue and caste am I, of every rank and religion,
A farmer, mechanic, artist, gentleman, sailor, quaker,
Prisoner, fancy-man, rowdy, lawyer, physician, priest.
I resist any thing better than my own diversity,
Breathe the air but leave plenty after me,
And am not stuck up, and am in my place.
(The moth and the fish-eggs are in their place,
The bright suns I see and the dark suns I cannot see are in their place,
The palpable is in its place and the impalpable is in its place.)17
These are really the thoughts of all men in all ages and lands, they are not original with me,
If they are not yours as much as mine they are nothing, or next to nothing,
If they are not the riddle and the untying of the riddle they are nothing,
If they are not just as close as they are distant they are nothing.
This is the grass that grows wherever the land is and the water is,
This the common air that bathes the globe.18
With music strong I come, with my cornets and my drums,
I play not marches for accepted victors only, I play marches for conquer’d and slain persons.
Have you heard that it was good to gain the day?
I also say it is good to fall, battles are lost in the same spirit in which they are won.
I beat and pound for the dead,
I blow through my embouchures my loudest and gayest for them.
Vivas to those who have fail’d!
And to those whose war-vessels sank in the sea!
And to those themselves who sank in the sea!
And to all generals that lost engagements, and all overcome heroes!
And the numberless unknown heroes equal to the greatest heroes known!19
This is the meal equally set, this the meat for natural hunger,
It is for the wicked just the same as the righteous, I make appointments with all,
I will not have a single person slighted or left away,
The kept-woman, sponger, thief, are hereby invited,
The heavy-lipp’d slave is invited, the venerealee is invited;
There shall be no difference between them and the rest.
This is the press of a bashful hand, this the float and odor of hair,
This the touch of my lips to yours, this the murmur of yearning,
This the far-off depth and height reflecting my own face,
This the thoughtful merge of myself, and the outlet again.
Do you guess I have some intricate purpose?
Well I have, for the Fourth-month showers have, and the mica on the side of a rock has.
Do you take it I would astonish?
Does the daylight astonish? does the early redstart twittering through the woods?
Do I astonish more than they?
This hour I tell things in confidence,
I might not tell everybody, but I will tell you.20
Who goes there? hankering, gross, mystical, nude;
How is it I extract strength from the beef I eat?
What is a man anyhow? what am I? what are you?
All I mark as my own you shall offset it with your own,
Else it were time lost listening to me.
I do not snivel that snivel the world over,
That months are vacuums and the ground but wallow and filth.
Whimpering and truckling fold with powders for invalids, conformity goes to the fourth-remov’d,
I wear my hat as I please indoors or out.
Why should I pray? why should I venerate and be ceremonious?
Having pried through the strata, analyzed to a hair, counsel’d with doctors and calculated close,
I find no sweeter fat than sticks to my own bones.
In all people I see myself, none more and not one a barley-corn less,
And the good or bad I say of myself I say of them.
I know I am solid and sound,
To me the converging objects of the universe perpetually flow,
All are written to me, and I must get what the writing means.
I know I am deathless,
I know this orbit of mine cannot be swept by a carpenter’s compass,
I know I shall not pass like a child’s carlacue cut with a burnt stick at night.
I know I am august,
I do not trouble my spirit to vindicate itself or be understood,
I see that the elementary laws never apologize,
(I reckon I behave no prouder than the level I plant my house by, after all.)
I exist as I am, that is enough,
If no other in the world be aware I sit content,
And if each and all be aware I sit content.
One world is aware and by far the largest to me, and that is myself,
And whether I come to my own to-day or in ten thousand or ten million years,
I can cheerfully take it now, or with equal cheerfulness I can wait.
My foothold is tenon’d and mortis’d in granite,
I laugh at what you call dissolution,
And I know the amplitude of time.21
I am the poet of the Body and I am the poet of the Soul,
The pleasures of heaven are with me and the pains of hell are with me,
The first I graft and increase upon myself, the latter I translate into a new tongue.
I am the poet of the woman the same as the man,
And I say it is as great to be a woman as to be a man,
And I say there is nothing greater than the mother of men.
I chant the chant of dilation or pride,
We have had ducking and deprecating about enough,
I show that size is only development.
Have you outstript the rest? are you the President?
It is a trifle, they will more than arrive there every one, and still pass on.
I am he that walks with the tender and growing night,
I call to the earth and sea half-held by the night.
Press close bare-bosom’d night—press close magnetic nourishing night!
Night of south winds—night of the large few stars!
Still nodding night—mad naked summer night.
Smile O voluptuous cool-breath’d earth!
Earth of the slumbering and liquid trees!
Earth of departed sunset—earth of the mountains misty-topt!
Earth of the vitreous pour of the full moon just tinged with blue!
Earth of shine and dark mottling the tide of the river!
Earth of the limpid gray of clouds brighter and clearer for my sake!
Far-swooping elbow’d earth—rich apple-blossom’d earth!
Smile, for your lover comes.
Prodigal, you have given me love—therefore I to you give love!
O unspeakable passionate love.22
You sea! I resign myself to you also—I guess what you mean,
I behold from the beach your crooked inviting fingers,
I believe you refuse to go back without feeling of me,
We must have a turn together, I undress, hurry me out of sight of the land,
Cushion me soft, rock me in billowy drowse,
Dash me with amorous wet, I can repay you.
Sea of stretch’d ground-swells,
Sea breathing broad and convulsive breaths,
Sea of the brine of life and of unshovell’d yet always-ready graves,
Howler and scooper of storms, capricious and dainty sea,
I am integral with you, I too am of one phase and of all phases.
Partaker of influx and efflux I, extoller of hate and conciliation,
Extoller of amies and those that sleep in each others’ arms.
I am he attesting sympathy,
(Shall I make my list of things in the house and skip the house that supports them?)
I am not the poet of goodness only, I do not decline to be the poet of wickedness also.
What blurt is this about virtue and about vice?
Evil propels me and reform of evil propels me, I stand indifferent,
My gait is no fault-finder’s or rejecter’s gait,
I moisten the roots of all that has grown.
Did you fear some scrofula out of the unflagging pregnancy?
Did you guess the celestial laws are yet to be work’d over and rectified?
I find one side a balance and the antipodal side a balance,
Soft doctrine as steady help as stable doctrine,
Thoughts and deeds of the present our rouse and early start.
This minute that comes to me over the past decillions,
There is no better than it and now.
What behaved well in the past or behaves well to-day is not such a wonder,
The wonder is always and always how there can be a mean man or an infidel.23
Endless unfolding of words of ages!
And mine a word of the modern, the word En-Masse.
A word of the faith that never balks,
Here or henceforward it is all the same to me, I accept Time absolutely.
It alone is without flaw, it alone rounds and completes all,
That mystic baffling wonder alone completes all.
I accept Reality and dare not question it,
Materialism first and last imbuing.
Hurrah for positive science! long live exact demonstration!
Fetch stonecrop mixt with cedar and branches of lilac,
This is the lexicographer, this the chemist, this made a grammar of the old cartouches,
These mariners put the ship through dangerous unknown seas.
This is the geologist, this works with the scalpel, and this is a mathematician.
Gentlemen, to you the first honors always!
Your facts are useful, and yet they are not my dwelling,
I but enter by them to an area of my dwelling.
Less the reminders of properties told my words,
And more the reminders they of life untold, and of freedom and extrication,
And make short account of neuters and geldings, and favor men and women fully equipt,
And beat the gong of revolt, and stop with fugitives and them that plot and conspire.24
Walt Whitman, a kosmos, of Manhattan the son,
Turbulent, fleshy, sensual, eating, drinking and breeding,
No sentimentalist, no stander above men and women or apart from them,
No more modest than immodest.
Unscrew the locks from the doors!
Unscrew the doors themselves from their jambs!
Whoever degrades another degrades me,
And whatever is done or said returns at last to me.
Through me the afflatus surging and surging, through me the current and index.
I speak the pass-word primeval, I give the sign of democracy,
By God! I will accept nothing which all cannot have their counterpart of on the same terms.
Through me many long dumb voices,
Voices of the interminable generations of prisoners and slaves,
Voices of the diseas’d and despairing and of thieves and dwarfs,
Voices of cycles of preparation and accretion,
And of the threads that connect the stars, and of wombs and of the father-stuff,
And of the rights of them the others are down upon,
Of the deform’d, trivial, flat, foolish, despised,
Fog in the air, beetles rolling balls of dung.
Through me forbidden voices,
Voices of sexes and lusts, voices veil’d and I remove the veil,
Voices indecent by me clarified and transfigur’d.
I do not press my fingers across my mouth,
I keep as delicate around the bowels as around the head and heart,
Copulation is no more rank to me than death is.
I believe in the flesh and the appetites,
Seeing, hearing, feeling, are miracles, and each part and tag of me is a miracle.
Divine am I inside and out, and I make holy whatever I touch or am touch’d from,
The scent of these arm-pits aroma finer than prayer,
This head more than churches, bibles, and all the creeds.
If I worship one thing more than another it shall be the spread of my own body, or any part of it,
Translucent mould of me it shall be you!
Shaded ledges and rests it shall be you!
Firm masculine colter it shall be you!
Whatever goes to the tilth of me it shall be you!
You my rich blood! your milky stream pale strippings of my life!
Breast that presses against other breasts it shall be you!
My brain it shall be your occult convolutions!
Root of wash’d sweet-flag! timorous pond-snipe! nest of guarded duplicate eggs! it shall be you!
Mix’d tussled hay of head, beard, brawn, it shall be you!
Trickling sap of maple, fibre of manly wheat, it shall be you!
Sun so generous it shall be you!
Vapors lighting and shading my face it shall be you!
You sweaty brooks and dews it shall be you!
Winds whose soft-tickling genitals rub against me it shall be you!
Broad muscular fields, branches of live oak, loving lounger in my winding paths, it shall be you!
Hands I have taken, face I have kiss’d, mortal I have ever touch’d, it shall be you.
I dote on myself, there is that lot of me and all so luscious,
Each moment and whatever happens thrills me with joy,
I cannot tell how my ankles bend, nor whence the cause of my faintest wish,
Nor the cause of the friendship I emit, nor the cause of the friendship I take again.
That I walk up my stoop, I pause to consider if it really be,
A morning-glory at my window satisfies me more than the metaphysics of books.
To behold the day-break!
The little light fades the immense and diaphanous shadows,
The air tastes good to my palate.
Hefts of the moving world at innocent gambols silently rising freshly exuding,
Scooting obliquely high and low.
Something I cannot see puts upward libidinous prongs,
Seas of bright juice suffuse heaven.
The earth by the sky staid with, the daily close of their junction,
The heav’d challenge from the east that moment over my head,
The mocking taunt, See then whether you shall be master!25
Dazzling and tremendous how quick the sun-rise would kill me,
If I could not now and always send sun-rise out of me.
We also ascend dazzling and tremendous as the sun,
We found our own O my soul in the calm and cool of the daybreak.
My voice goes after what my eyes cannot reach,
With the twirl of my tongue I encompass worlds and volumes of worlds.
Speech is the twin of my vision, it is unequal to measure itself,
It provokes me forever, it says sarcastically,Walt you contain enough, why don’t you let it out then?
Come now I will not be tantalized, you conceive too much of articulation,
Do you not know O speech how the buds beneath you are folded?
Waiting in gloom, protected by frost,
The dirt receding before my prophetical screams,
I underlying causes to balance them at last,
My knowledge my live parts, it keeping tally with the meaning of all things,
Happiness, (which whoever hears me let him or her set out in search of this day.)
My final merit I refuse you, I refuse putting from me what I really am,
Encompass worlds, but never try to encompass me,
I crowd your sleekest and best by simply looking toward you.
Writing and talk do not prove me,
I carry the plenum of proof and every thing else in my face,
With the hush of my lips I wholly confound the skeptic.26
Now I will do nothing but listen,
To accrue what I hear into this song, to let sounds contribute toward it.
I hear bravuras of birds, bustle of growing wheat, gossip of flames, clack of sticks cooking my meals,
I hear the sound I love, the sound of the human voice,
I hear all sounds running together, combined, fused or following,
Sounds of the city and sounds out of the city, sounds of the day and night,
Talkative young ones to those that like them, the loud laugh of work-people at their meals,
The angry base of disjointed friendship, the faint tones of the sick,
The judge with hands tight to the desk, his pallid lips pronouncing a death-sentence,
The heave’e’yo of stevedores unlading ships by the wharves, the refrain of the anchor-lifters,
The ring of alarm-bells, the cry of fire, the whirr of swift-streaking engines and hose-carts with premonitory tinkles and color’d lights,
The steam whistle, the solid roll of the train of approaching cars,
The slow march play’d at the head of the association marching two and two,
(They go to guard some corpse, the flag-tops are draped with black muslin.)
I hear the violoncello, (’tis the young man’s heart’s complaint,)
I hear the key’d cornet, it glides quickly in through my ears,
It shakes mad-sweet pangs through my belly and breast.
I hear the chorus, it is a grand opera,
Ah this indeed is music—this suits me.
A tenor large and fresh as the creation fills me,
The orbic flex of his mouth is pouring and filling me full.
I hear the train’d soprano (what work with hers is this?)
The orchestra whirls me wider than Uranus flies,
It wrenches such ardors from me I did not know I possess’d them,
It sails me, I dab with bare feet, they are lick’d by the indolent waves,
I am cut by bitter and angry hail, I lose my breath,
Steep’d amid honey’d morphine, my windpipe throttled in fakes of death,
At length let up again to feel the puzzle of puzzles,
And that we call Being.27
To be in any form, what is that?
(Round and round we go, all of us, and ever come back thither,)
If nothing lay more develop’d the quahaug in its callous shell were enough.
Mine is no callous shell,
I have instant conductors all over me whether I pass or stop,
They seize every object and lead it harmlessly through me.
I merely stir, press, feel with my fingers, and am happy,
To touch my person to some one else’s is about as much as I can stand.28
Is this then a touch? quivering me to a new identity,
Flames and ether making a rush for my veins,
Treacherous tip of me reaching and crowding to help them,
My flesh and blood playing out lightning to strike what is hardly different from myself,
On all sides prurient provokers stiffening my limbs,
Straining the udder of my heart for its withheld drip,
Behaving licentious toward me, taking no denial,
Depriving me of my best as for a purpose,
Unbuttoning my clothes, holding me by the bare waist,
Deluding my confusion with the calm of the sunlight and pasture-fields,
Immodestly sliding the fellow-senses away,
They bribed to swap off with touch and go and graze at the edges of me,
No consideration, no regard for my draining strength or my anger,
Fetching the rest of the herd around to enjoy them a while,
Then all uniting to stand on a headland and worry me.
The sentries desert every other part of me,
They have left me helpless to a red marauder,
They all come to the headland to witness and assist against me.
I am given up by traitors,
I talk wildly, I have lost my wits, I and nobody else am the greatest traitor,
I went myself first to the headland, my own hands carried me there.
You villain touch! what are you doing? my breath is tight in its throat,
Unclench your floodgates, you are too much for me.29
Blind loving wrestling touch, sheath’d hooded sharp-tooth’d touch!
Did it make you ache so, leaving me?
Parting track’d by arriving, perpetual payment of perpetual loan,
Rich showering rain, and recompense richer afterward.
Sprouts take and accumulate, stand by the curb prolific and vital,
Landscapes projected masculine, full-sized and golden.30
All truths wait in all things,
They neither hasten their own delivery nor resist it,
They do not need the obstetric forceps of the surgeon,
The insignificant is as big to me as any,
(What is less or more than a touch?)
Logic and sermons never convince,
The damp of the night drives deeper into my soul.
(Only what proves itself to every man and woman is so,
Only what nobody denies is so.)
A minute and a drop of me settle my brain,
I believe the soggy clods shall become lovers and lamps,
And a compend of compends is the meat of a man or woman,
And a summit and flower there is the feeling they have for each other,
And they are to branch boundlessly out of that lesson until it becomes omnific,
And until one and all shall delight us, and we them.31
I believe a leaf of grass is no less than the journey-work of the stars,
And the pismire is equally perfect, and a grain of sand, and the egg of the wren,
And the tree-toad is a chef-d’œuvre for the highest,
And the running blackberry would adorn the parlors of heaven,
And the narrowest hinge in my hand puts to scorn all machinery,
And the cow crunching with depress’d head surpasses any statue,
And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels.
I find I incorporate gneiss, coal, long-threaded moss, fruits, grains, esculent roots,
And am stucco’d with quadrupeds and birds all over,
And have distanced what is behind me for good reasons,
But call any thing back again when I desire it.
In vain the speeding or shyness,
In vain the plutonic rocks send their old heat against my approach,
In vain the mastodon retreats beneath its own powder’d bones,
In vain objects stand leagues off and assume manifold shapes,
In vain the ocean settling in hollows and the great monsters lying low,
In vain the buzzard houses herself with the sky,
In vain the snake slides through the creepers and logs,
In vain the elk takes to the inner passes of the woods,
In vain the razor-bill’d auk sails far north to Labrador,
I follow quickly, I ascend to the nest in the fissure of the cliff.32
I think I could turn and live with animals, they are so placid and self-contain’d,
I stand and look at them long and long.
They do not sweat and whine about their condition,
They do not lie awake in the dark and weep for their sins,
They do not make me sick discussing their duty to God,
Not one is dissatisfied, not one is demented with the mania of owning things,
Not one kneels to another, nor to his kind that lived thousands of years ago,
Not one is respectable or unhappy over the whole earth.
So they show their relations to me and I accept them,
They bring me tokens of myself, they evince them plainly in their possession.
I wonder where they get those tokens,
Did I pass that way huge times ago and negligently drop them?
Myself moving forward then and now and forever,
Gathering and showing more always and with velocity,
Infinite and omnigenous, and the like of these among them,
Not too exclusive toward the reachers of my remembrancers,
Picking out here one that I love, and now go with him on brotherly terms.
A gigantic beauty of a stallion, fresh and responsive to my caresses,
Head high in the forehead, wide between the ears,
Limbs glossy and supple, tail dusting the ground,
Eyes full of sparkling wickedness, ears finely cut, flexibly moving.
His nostrils dilate as my heels embrace him,
His well-built limbs tremble with pleasure as we race around and return.
I but use you a minute, then I resign you, stallion,
Why do I need your paces when I myself out-gallop them?
Even as I stand or sit passing faster than you.33
Space and Time! now I see it is true, what I guess’d at,
What I guess’d when I loaf’d on the grass,
What I guess’d while I lay alone in my bed,
And again as I walk’d the beach under the paling stars of the morning.
My ties and ballasts leave me, my elbows rest in sea-gaps,
I skirt sierras, my palms cover continents,
I am afoot with my vision.
By the city’s quadrangular houses—in log huts, camping with lumbermen,
Along the ruts of the turnpike, along the dry gulch and rivulet bed,
Weeding my onion-patch or hoeing rows of carrots and parsnips, crossing savannas, trailing in forests,
Prospecting, gold-digging, girdling the trees of a new purchase,
Scorch’d ankle-deep by the hot sand, hauling my boat down the shallow river,
Where the panther walks to and fro on a limb overhead, where the buck turns furiously at the hunter,
Where the rattlesnake suns his flabby length on a rock, where the otter is feeding on fish,
Where the alligator in his tough pimples sleeps by the bayou,
Where the black bear is searching for roots or honey, where the beaver pats the mud with his paddle-shaped tail;
Over the growing sugar, over the yellow-flower’d cotton plant, over the rice in its low moist field,
Over the sharp-peak’d farm house, with its scallop’d scum and slender shoots from the gutters,
Over the western persimmon, over the long-leav’d corn, over the delicate blue-flower flax,
Over the white and brown buckwheat, a hummer and buzzer there with the rest,
Over the dusky green of the rye as it ripples and shades in the breeze;
Scaling mountains, pulling myself cautiously up, holding on by low scragged limbs,
Walking the path worn in the grass and beat through the leaves of the brush,
Where the quail is whistling betwixt the woods and the wheat-lot,
Where the bat flies in the Seventh-month eve, where the great gold-bug drops through the dark,
Where the brook puts out of the roots of the old tree and flows to the meadow,
Where cattle stand and shake away flies with the tremulous shuddering of their hides,
Where the cheese-cloth hangs in the kitchen, where andirons straddle the hearth-slab, where cobwebs fall in festoons from the rafters;
Where trip-hammers crash, where the press is whirling its cylinders,
Wherever the human heart beats with terrible throes under its ribs,
Where the pear-shaped balloon is floating aloft, (floating in it myself and looking composedly down,)
Where the life-car is drawn on the slip-noose, where the heat hatches pale-green eggs in the dented sand,
Where the she-whale swims with her calf and never forsakes it,
Where the steam-ship trails hind-ways its long pennant of smoke,
Where the fin of the shark cuts like a black chip out of the water,
Where the half-burn’d brig is riding on unknown currents,
Where shells grow to her slimy deck, where the dead are corrupting below;
Where the dense-starr’d flag is borne at the head of the regiments,
Approaching Manhattan up by the long-stretching island,
Under Niagara, the cataract falling like a veil over my countenance,
Upon a door-step, upon the horse-block of hard wood outside,
Upon the race-course, or enjoying picnics or jigs or a good game of base-ball,
At he-festivals, with blackguard gibes, ironical license, bull-dances, drinking, laughter,
At the cider-mill tasting the sweets of the brown mash, sucking the juice through a straw,
At apple-peelings wanting kisses for all the red fruit I find,
At musters, beach-parties, friendly bees, huskings, house-raisings;
Where the mocking-bird sounds his delicious gurgles, cackles, screams, weeps,
Where the hay-rick stands in the barn-yard, where the dry-stalks are scatter’d, where the brood-cow waits in the hovel,
Where the bull advances to do his masculine work, where the stud to the mare, where the cock is treading the hen,
Where the heifers browse, where geese nip their food with short jerks,
Where sun-down shadows lengthen over the limitless and lonesome prairie,
Where herds of buffalo make a crawling spread of the square miles far and near,
Where the humming-bird shimmers, where the neck of the long-lived swan is curving and winding,
Where the laughing-gull scoots by the shore, where she laughs her near-human laugh,
Where bee-hives range on a gray bench in the garden half hid by the high weeds,
Where band-neck’d partridges roost in a ring on the ground with their heads out,
Where burial coaches enter the arch’d gates of a cemetery,
Where winter wolves bark amid wastes of snow and icicled trees,
Where the yellow-crown’d heron comes to the edge of the marsh at night and feeds upon small crabs,
Where the splash of swimmers and divers cools the warm noon,
Where the katy-did works her chromatic reed on the walnut-tree over the well,
Through patches of citrons and cucumbers with silver-wired leaves,
Through the salt-lick or orange glade, or under conical firs,
Through the gymnasium, through the curtain’d saloon, through the office or public hall;
Pleas’d with the native and pleas’d with the foreign, pleas’d with the new and old,
Pleas’d with the homely woman as well as the handsome,
Pleas’d with the quakeress as she puts off her bonnet and talks melodiously,
Pleas’d with the tune of the choir of the whitewash’d church,
Pleas’d with the earnest words of the sweating Methodist preacher, impress’d seriously at the camp-meeting;
Looking in at the shop-windows of Broadway the whole forenoon, flatting the flesh of my nose on the thick plate glass,
Wandering the same afternoon with my face turn’d up to the clouds, or down a lane or along the beach,
My right and left arms round the sides of two friends, and I in the middle;
Coming home with the silent and dark-cheek’d bush-boy, (behind me he rides at the drape of the day,)
Far from the settlements studying the print of animals’ feet, or the moccasin print,
By the cot in the hospital reaching lemonade to a feverish patient,
Nigh the coffin’d corpse when all is still, examining with a candle;
Voyaging to every port to dicker and adventure,
Hurrying with the modern crowd as eager and fickle as any,
Hot toward one I hate, ready in my madness to knife him,
Solitary at midnight in my back yard, my thoughts gone from me a long while,
Walking the old hills of Judæa with the beautiful gentle God by my side,
Speeding through space, speeding through heaven and the stars,
Speeding amid the seven satellites and the broad ring, and the diameter of eighty thousand miles,
Speeding with tail’d meteors, throwing fire-balls like the rest,
Carrying the crescent child that carries its own full mother in its belly,
Storming, enjoying, planning, loving, cautioning,
Backing and filling, appearing and disappearing,
I tread day and night such roads.
I visit the orchards of spheres and look at the product,
And look at quintillions ripen’d and look at quintillions green.
I fly those flights of a fluid and swallowing soul,
My course runs below the soundings of plummets.
I help myself to material and immaterial,
No guard can shut me off, no law prevent me.
I anchor my ship for a little while only,
My messengers continually cruise away or bring their returns to me.
I go hunting polar furs and the seal, leaping chasms with a pike-pointed staff, clinging to topples of brittle and blue.
I ascend to the foretruck,
I take my place late at night in the crow’s-nest,
We sail the arctic sea, it is plenty light enough,
Through the clear atmosphere I stretch around on the wonderful beauty,
The enormous masses of ice pass me and I pass them, the scenery is plain in all directions,
The white-topt mountains show in the distance, I fling out my fancies toward them,
We are approaching some great battle-field in which we are soon to be engaged,
We pass the colossal outposts of the encampment, we pass with still feet and caution,
Or we are entering by the suburbs some vast and ruin’d city,
The blocks and fallen architecture more than all the living cities of the globe.
I am a free companion, I bivouac by invading watchfires,
I turn the bridegroom out of bed and stay with the bride myself,
I tighten her all night to my thighs and lips.
My voice is the wife’s voice, the screech by the rail of the stairs,
They fetch my man’s body up dripping and drown’d.
I understand the large hearts of heroes,
The courage of present times and all times,
How the skipper saw the crowded and rudderless wreck of the steam-ship, and Death chasing it up and down the storm,
How he knuckled tight and gave not back an inch, and was faithful of days and faithful of nights,
And chalk’d in large letters on a board, Be of good cheer, we will not desert you;
How he follow’d with them and tack’d with them three days and would not give it up,
How he saved the drifting company at last,
How the lank loose-gown’d women look’d when boated from the side of their prepared graves,
How the silent old-faced infants and the lifted sick, and the sharp-lipp’d unshaved men;
All this I swallow, it tastes good, I like it well, it becomes mine,
I am the man, I suffer’d, I was there.
The disdain and calmness of martyrs,
The mother of old, condemn’d for a witch, burnt with dry wood, her children gazing on,
The hounded slave that flags in the race, leans by the fence, blowing, cover’d with sweat,
The twinges that sting like needles his legs and neck, the murderous buckshot and the bullets,
All these I feel or am.
I am the hounded slave, I wince at the bite of the dogs,
Hell and despair are upon me, crack and again crack the marksmen,
I clutch the rails of the fence, my gore dribs, thinn’d with the ooze of my skin,
I fall on the weeds and stones,
The riders spur their unwilling horses, haul close,
Taunt my dizzy ears and beat me violently over the head with whip-stocks.
Agonies are one of my changes of garments,
I do not ask the wounded person how he feels, I myself become the wounded person,
My hurts turn livid upon me as I lean on a cane and observe.
I am the mash’d fireman with breast-bone broken,
Tumbling walls buried me in their debris,
Heat and smoke I inspired, I heard the yelling shouts of my comrades,
I heard the distant click of their picks and shovels,
They have clear’d the beams away, they tenderly lift me forth.
I lie in the night air in my red shirt, the pervading hush is for my sake,
Painless after all I lie exhausted but not so unhappy,
White and beautiful are the faces around me, the heads are bared of their fire-caps,
The kneeling crowd fades with the light of the torches.
Distant and dead resuscitate,
They show as the dial or move as the hands of me, I am the clock myself.
I am an old artillerist, I tell of my fort’s bombardment,
I am there again.
Again the long roll of the drummers,
Again the attacking cannon, mortars,
Again to my listening ears the cannon responsive.
I take part, I see and hear the whole,
The cries, curses, roar, the plaudits for well-aim’d shots,
The ambulanza slowly passing trailing its red drip,
Workmen searching after damages, making indispensable repairs,
The fall of grenades through the rent roof, the fan-shaped explosion,
The whizz of limbs, heads, stone, wood, iron, high in the air.
Again gurgles the mouth of my dying general, he furiously waves with his hand,
He gasps through the clot Mind not me—mind—the entrenchments.34
Now I tell what I knew in Texas in my early youth,
(I tell not the fall of Alamo,
Not one escaped to tell the fall of Alamo,
The hundred and fifty are dumb yet at Alamo,)
’Tis the tale of the murder in cold blood of four hundred and twelve young men.
Retreating they had form’d in a hollow square with their baggage for breastworks,
Nine hundred lives out of the surrounding enemy’s, nine times their number, was the price they took in advance,
Their colonel was wounded and their ammunition gone,
They treated for an honorable capitulation, receiv’d writing and seal, gave up their arms and march’d back prisoners of war.
They were the glory of the race of rangers,
Matchless with horse, rifle, song, supper, courtship,
Large, turbulent, generous, handsome, proud, and affectionate,
Bearded, sunburnt, drest in the free costume of hunters,
Not a single one over thirty years of age.
The second First-day morning they were brought out in squads and massacred, it was beautiful early summer,
The work commenced about five o’clock and was over by eight.
None obey’d the command to kneel,
Some made a mad and helpless rush, some stood stark and straight,
A few fell at once, shot in the temple or heart, the living and dead lay together,
The maim’d and mangled dug in the dirt, the new-comers saw them there,
Some half-kill’d attempted to crawl away,
These were despatch’d with bayonets or batter’d with the blunts of muskets,
A youth not seventeen years old seiz’d his assassin till two more came to release him,
The three were all torn and cover’d with the boy’s blood.
At eleven o’clock began the burning of the bodies;
That is the tale of the murder of the four hundred and twelve young men.35
Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.
Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;
Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.
We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,
My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.
We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.
Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.
Our frigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting.
Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast,
Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.
Not a moment’s cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.
One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.
Serene stands the little captain,
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.36
Stretch’d and still lies the midnight,
Two great hulls motionless on the breast of the darkness,
Our vessel riddled and slowly sinking, preparations to pass to the one we have conquer’d,
The captain on the quarter-deck coldly giving his orders through a countenance white as a sheet,
Near by the corpse of the child that serv’d in the cabin,
The dead face of an old salt with long white hair and carefully curl’d whiskers,
The flames spite of all that can be done flickering aloft and below,
The husky voices of the two or three officers yet fit for duty,
Formless stacks of bodies and bodies by themselves, dabs of flesh upon the masts and spars,
Cut of cordage, dangle of rigging, slight shock of the soothe of waves,
Black and impassive guns, litter of powder-parcels, strong scent,
A few large stars overhead, silent and mournful shining,
Delicate sniffs of sea-breeze, smells of sedgy grass and fields by the shore, death-messages given in charge to survivors,
The hiss of the surgeon’s knife, the gnawing teeth of his saw,
Wheeze, cluck, swash of falling blood, short wild scream, and long, dull, tapering groan,
These so, these irretrievable.37
You laggards there on guard! look to your arms!
In at the conquer’d doors they crowd! I am possess’d!
Embody all presences outlaw’d or suffering,
See myself in prison shaped like another man,
And feel the dull unintermitted pain.
For me the keepers of convicts shoulder their carbines and keep watch,
It is I let out in the morning and barr’d at night.
Not a mutineer walks handcuff’d to jail but I am handcuff’d to him and walk by his side,
(I am less the jolly one there, and more the silent one with sweat on my twitching lips.)
Not a youngster is taken for larceny but I go up too, and am tried and sentenced.
Not a cholera patient lies at the last gasp but I also lie at the last gasp,
My face is ash-color’d, my sinews gnarl, away from me people retreat.
Askers embody themselves in me and I am embodied in them,
I project my hat, sit shame-faced, and beg.38
Enough! enough! enough!
Somehow I have been stunn’d. Stand back!
Give me a little time beyond my cuff’d head, slumbers, dreams, gaping,
I discover myself on the verge of a usual mistake.
That I could forget the mockers and insults!
That I could forget the trickling tears and the blows of the bludgeons and hammers!
That I could look with a separate look on my own crucifixion and bloody crowning.
I remember now,
I resume the overstaid fraction,
The grave of rock multiplies what has been confided to it, or to any graves,
Corpses rise, gashes heal, fastenings roll from me.
I troop forth replenish’d with supreme power, one of an average unending procession,
Inland and sea-coast we go, and pass all boundary lines,
Our swift ordinances on their way over the whole earth,
The blossoms we wear in our hats the growth of thousands of years.
Eleves, I salute you! come forward!
Continue your annotations, continue your questionings.39
The friendly and flowing savage, who is he?
Is he waiting for civilization, or past it and mastering it?
Is he some Southwesterner rais’d out-doors? is he Kanadian?
Is he from the Mississippi country? Iowa, Oregon, California?
The mountains? prairie-life, bush-life? or sailor from the sea?
Wherever he goes men and women accept and desire him,
They desire he should like them, touch them, speak to them, stay with them.
Behavior lawless as snow-flakes, words simple as grass, uncomb’d head, laughter, and naiveté,
Slow-stepping feet, common features, common modes and emanations,
They descend in new forms from the tips of his fingers,
They are wafted with the odor of his body or breath, they fly out of the glance of his eyes.40
Flaunt of the sunshine I need not your bask—lie over!
You light surfaces only, I force surfaces and depths also.
Earth! you seem to look for something at my hands,
Say, old top-knot, what do you want?
Man or woman, I might tell how I like you, but cannot,
And might tell what it is in me and what it is in you, but cannot,
And might tell that pining I have, that pulse of my nights and days.
Behold, I do not give lectures or a little charity,
When I give I give myself.
You there, impotent, loose in the knees,
Open your scarf’d chops till I blow grit within you,
Spread your palms and lift the flaps of your pockets,
I am not to be denied, I compel, I have stores plenty and to spare,
And any thing I have I bestow.
I do not ask who you are, that is not important to me,
You can do nothing and be nothing but what I will infold you.
To cotton-field drudge or cleaner of privies I lean,
On his right cheek I put the family kiss,
And in my soul I swear I never will deny him.
On women fit for conception I start bigger and nimbler babes.
(This day I am jetting the stuff of far more arrogant republics.)
To any one dying, thither I speed and twist the knob of the door.
Turn the bed-clothes toward the foot of the bed,
Let the physician and the priest go home.
I seize the descending man and raise him with resistless will,
O despairer, here is my neck,
By God, you shall not go down! hang your whole weight upon me.
I dilate you with tremendous breath, I buoy you up,
Every room of the house do I fill with an arm’d force,
Lovers of me, bafflers of graves.
Sleep—I and they keep guard all night,
Not doubt, not decease shall dare to lay finger upon you,
I have embraced you, and henceforth possess you to myself,
And when you rise in the morning you will find what I tell you is so.41
I am he bringing help for the sick as they pant on their backs,
And for strong upright men I bring yet more needed help.
I heard what was said of the universe,
Heard it and heard it of several thousand years;
It is middling well as far as it goes—but is that all?
Magnifying and applying come I,
Outbidding at the start the old cautious hucksters,
Taking myself the exact dimensions of Jehovah,
Lithographing Kronos, Zeus his son, and Hercules his grandson,
Buying drafts of Osiris, Isis, Belus, Brahma, Buddha,
In my portfolio placing Manito loose, Allah on a leaf, the crucifix engraved,
With Odin and the hideous-faced Mexitli and every idol and image,
Taking them all for what they are worth and not a cent more,
Admitting they were alive and did the work of their days,
(They bore mites as for unfledg’d birds who have now to rise and fly and sing for themselves,)
Accepting the rough deific sketches to fill out better in myself, bestowing them freely on each man and woman I see,
Discovering as much or more in a framer framing a house,
Putting higher claims for him there with his roll’d-up sleeves driving the mallet and chisel,
Not objecting to special revelations, considering a curl of smoke or a hair on the back of my hand just as curious as any revelation,
Lads ahold of fire-engines and hook-and-ladder ropes no less to me than the gods of the antique wars,
Minding their voices peal through the crash of destruction,
Their brawny limbs passing safe over charr’d laths, their white foreheads whole and unhurt out of the flames;
By the mechanic’s wife with her babe at her nipple interceding for every person born,
Three scythes at harvest whizzing in a row from three lusty angels with shirts bagg’d out at their waists,
The snag-tooth’d hostler with red hair redeeming sins past and to come,
Selling all he possesses, traveling on foot to fee lawyers for his brother and sit by him while he is tried for forgery;
What was strewn in the amplest strewing the square rod about me, and not filling the square rod then,
The bull and the bug never worshipp’d half enough,
Dung and dirt more admirable than was dream’d,
The supernatural of no account, myself waiting my time to be one of the supremes,
The day getting ready for me when I shall do as much good as the best, and be as prodigious;
By my life-lumps! becoming already a creator,
Putting myself here and now to the ambush’d womb of the shadows.42
A call in the midst of the crowd,
My own voice, orotund sweeping and final.
Come my children,
Come my boys and girls, my women, household and intimates,
Now the performer launches his nerve, he has pass’d his prelude on the reeds within.
Easily written loose-finger’d chords—I feel the thrum of your climax and close.
My head slues round on my neck,
Music rolls, but not from the organ,
Folks are around me, but they are no household of mine.
Ever the hard unsunk ground,
Ever the eaters and drinkers, ever the upward and downward sun, ever the air and the ceaseless tides,
Ever myself and my neighbors, refreshing, wicked, real,
Ever the old inexplicable query, ever that thorn’d thumb, that breath of itches and thirsts,
Ever the vexer’s hoot! hoot! till we find where the sly one hides and bring him forth,
Ever love, ever the sobbing liquid of life,
Ever the bandage under the chin, ever the trestles of death.
Here and there with dimes on the eyes walking,
To feed the greed of the belly the brains liberally spooning,
Tickets buying, taking, selling, but in to the feast never once going,
Many sweating, ploughing, thrashing, and then the chaff for payment receiving,
A few idly owning, and they the wheat continually claiming.
This is the city and I am one of the citizens,
Whatever interests the rest interests me, politics, wars, markets, newspapers, schools,
The mayor and councils, banks, tariffs, steamships, factories, stocks, stores, real estate and personal estate.
The little plentiful manikins skipping around in collars and tail’d coats,
I am aware who they are, (they are positively not worms or fleas,)
I acknowledge the duplicates of myself, the weakest and shallowest is deathless with me,
What I do and say the same waits for them,
Every thought that flounders in me the same flounders in them.
I know perfectly well my own egotism,
Know my omnivorous lines and must not write any less,
And would fetch you whoever you are flush with myself.
Not words of routine this song of mine,
But abruptly to question, to leap beyond yet nearer bring;
This printed and bound book—but the printer and the printing-office boy?
The well-taken photographs—but your wife or friend close and solid in your arms?
The black ship mail’d with iron, her mighty guns in her turrets—but the pluck of the captain and engineers?
In the houses the dishes and fare and furniture—but the host and hostess, and the look out of their eyes?
The sky up there—yet here or next door, or across the way?
The saints and sages in history—but you yourself?
Sermons, creeds, theology—but the fathomless human brain,
And what is reason? and what is love? and what is life?43
I do not despise you priests, all time, the world over,
My faith is the greatest of faiths and the least of faiths,
Enclosing worship ancient and modern and all between ancient and modern,
Believing I shall come again upon the earth after five thousand years,
Waiting responses from oracles, honoring the gods, saluting the sun,
Making a fetich of the first rock or stump, powowing with sticks in the circle of obis,
Helping the llama or brahmin as he trims the lamps of the idols,
Dancing yet through the streets in a phallic procession, rapt and austere in the woods a gymnosophist,
Drinking mead from the skull-cup, to Shastas and Vedas admirant, minding the Koran,
Walking the teokallis, spotted with gore from the stone and knife, beating the serpent-skin drum,
Accepting the Gospels, accepting him that was crucified, knowing assuredly that he is divine,
To the mass kneeling or the puritan’s prayer rising, or sitting patiently in a pew,
Ranting and frothing in my insane crisis, or waiting dead-like till my spirit arouses me,
Looking forth on pavement and land, or outside of pavement and land,
Belonging to the winders of the circuit of circuits.
One of that centripetal and centrifugal gang I turn and talk like a man leaving charges before a journey.
Down-hearted doubters dull and excluded,
Frivolous, sullen, moping, angry, affected, dishearten’d, atheistical,
I know every one of you, I know the sea of torment, doubt, despair and unbelief.
How the flukes splash!
How they contort rapid as lightning, with spasms and spouts of blood!
Be at peace bloody flukes of doubters and sullen mopers,
I take my place among you as much as among any,
The past is the push of you, me, all, precisely the same,
And what is yet untried and afterward is for you, me, all, precisely the same.
I do not know what is untried and afterward,
But I know it will in its turn prove sufficient, and cannot fail.
Each who passes is consider’d, each who stops is consider’d, not a single one can it fail.
It cannot fail the young man who died and was buried,
Nor the young woman who died and was put by his side,
Nor the little child that peep’d in at the door, and then drew back and was never seen again,
Nor the old man who has lived without purpose, and feels it with bitterness worse than gall,
Nor him in the poor house tubercled by rum and the bad disorder,
Nor the numberless slaughter’d and wreck’d, nor the brutish koboo call’d the ordure of humanity,
Nor the sacs merely floating with open mouths for food to slip in,
Nor any thing in the earth, or down in the oldest graves of the earth,
Nor any thing in the myriads of spheres, nor the myriads of myriads that inhabit them,
Nor the present, nor the least wisp that is known.44
It is time to explain myself—let us stand up.
What is known I strip away,
I launch all men and women forward with me into the Unknown.
The clock indicates the moment—but what does eternity indicate?
We have thus far exhausted trillions of winters and summers,
There are trillions ahead, and trillions ahead of them.
Births have brought us richness and variety,
And other births will bring us richness and variety.
I do not call one greater and one smaller,
That which fills its period and place is equal to any.
Were mankind murderous or jealous upon you, my brother, my sister?
I am sorry for you, they are not murderous or jealous upon me,
All has been gentle with me, I keep no account with lamentation,
(What have I to do with lamentation?)
I am an acme of things accomplish’d, and I an encloser of things to be.
My feet strike an apex of the apices of the stairs,
On every step bunches of ages, and larger bunches between the steps,
All below duly travel’d, and still I mount and mount.
Rise after rise bow the phantoms behind me,
Afar down I see the huge first Nothing, I know I was even there,
I waited unseen and always, and slept through the lethargic mist,
And took my time, and took no hurt from the fetid carbon.
Long I was hugg’d close—long and long.
Immense have been the preparations for me,
Faithful and friendly the arms that have help’d me.
Cycles ferried my cradle, rowing and rowing like cheerful boatmen,
For room to me stars kept aside in their own rings,
They sent influences to look after what was to hold me.
Before I was born out of my mother generations guided me,
My embryo has never been torpid, nothing could overlay it.
For it the nebula cohered to an orb,
The long slow strata piled to rest it on,
Vast vegetables gave it sustenance,
Monstrous sauroids transported it in their mouths and deposited it with care.
All forces have been steadily employ’d to complete and delight me,
Now on this spot I stand with my robust soul.45
O span of youth! ever-push’d elasticity!
O manhood, balanced, florid and full.
My lovers suffocate me,
Crowding my lips, thick in the pores of my skin,
Jostling me through streets and public halls, coming naked to me at night,
Crying by day Ahoy! from the rocks of the river, swinging and chirping over my head,
Calling my name from flower-beds, vines, tangled underbrush,
Lighting on every moment of my life,
Bussing my body with soft balsamic busses,
Noiselessly passing handfuls out of their hearts and giving them to be mine.
Old age superbly rising! O welcome, ineffable grace of dying days!
Every condition promulges not only itself, it promulges what grows after and out of itself,
And the dark hush promulges as much as any.
I open my scuttle at night and see the far-sprinkled systems,
And all I see multiplied as high as I can cipher edge but the rim of the farther systems.
Wider and wider they spread, expanding, always expanding,
Outward and outward and forever outward.
My sun has his sun and round him obediently wheels,
He joins with his partners a group of superior circuit,
And greater sets follow, making specks of the greatest inside them.
There is no stoppage and never can be stoppage,
If I, you, and the worlds, and all beneath or upon their surfaces, were this moment reduced back to a pallid float, it would not avail in the long run,
We should surely bring up again where we now stand,
And surely go as much farther, and then farther and farther.
A few quadrillions of eras, a few octillions of cubic leagues, do not hazard the span or make it impatient,
They are but parts, any thing is but a part.
See ever so far, there is limitless space outside of that,
Count ever so much, there is limitless time around that.
My rendezvous is appointed, it is certain,
The Lord will be there and wait till I come on perfect terms,
The great Camerado, the lover true for whom I pine will be there.46
I know I have the best of time and space, and was never measured and never will be measured.
I tramp a perpetual journey, (come listen all!)
My signs are a rain-proof coat, good shoes, and a staff cut from the woods,
No friend of mine takes his ease in my chair,
I have no chair, no church, no philosophy,
I lead no man to a dinner-table, library, exchange,
But each man and each woman of you I lead upon a knoll,
My left hand hooking you round the waist,
My right hand pointing to landscapes of continents and the public road.
Not I, not any one else can travel that road for you,
You must travel it for yourself.
It is not far, it is within reach,
Perhaps you have been on it since you were born and did not know,
Perhaps it is everywhere on water and on land.
Shoulder your duds dear son, and I will mine, and let us hasten forth,
Wonderful cities and free nations we shall fetch as we go.
If you tire, give me both burdens, and rest the chuff of your hand on my hip,
And in due time you shall repay the same service to me,
For after we start we never lie by again.
This day before dawn I ascended a hill and look’d at the crowded heaven,
And I said to my spirit When we become the enfolders of those orbs, and the pleasure and knowledge of every thing in them, shall we be fill’d and satisfied then?
And my spirit said No, we but level that lift to pass and continue beyond.
You are also asking me questions and I hear you,
I answer that I cannot answer, you must find out for yourself.
Sit a while dear son,
Here are biscuits to eat and here is milk to drink,
But as soon as you sleep and renew yourself in sweet clothes, I kiss you with a good-by kiss and open the gate for your egress hence.
Long enough have you dream’d contemptible dreams,
Now I wash the gum from your eyes,
You must habit yourself to the dazzle of the light and of every moment of your life.
Long have you timidly waded holding a plank by the shore,
Now I will you to be a bold swimmer,
To jump off in the midst of the sea, rise again, nod to me, shout, and laughingly dash with your hair.47
I am the teacher of athletes,
He that by me spreads a wider breast than my own proves the width of my own,
He most honors my style who learns under it to destroy the teacher.
The boy I love, the same becomes a man not through derived power, but in his own right,
Wicked rather than virtuous out of conformity or fear,
Fond of his sweetheart, relishing well his steak,
Unrequited love or a slight cutting him worse than sharp steel cuts,
First-rate to ride, to fight, to hit the bull’s eye, to sail a skiff, to sing a song or play on the banjo,
Preferring scars and the beard and faces pitted with small-pox over all latherers,
And those well-tann’d to those that keep out of the sun.
I teach straying from me, yet who can stray from me?
I follow you whoever you are from the present hour,
My words itch at your ears till you understand them.
I do not say these things for a dollar or to fill up the time while I wait for a boat,
(It is you talking just as much as myself, I act as the tongue of you,
Tied in your mouth, in mine it begins to be loosen’d.)
I swear I will never again mention love or death inside a house,
And I swear I will never translate myself at all, only to him or her who privately stays with me in the open air.
If you would understand me go to the heights or water-shore,
The nearest gnat is an explanation, and a drop or motion of waves a key,
The maul, the oar, the hand-saw, second my words.
No shutter’d room or school can commune with me,
But roughs and little children better than they.
The young mechanic is closest to me, he knows me well,
The woodman that takes his axe and jug with him shall take me with him all day,
The farm-boy ploughing in the field feels good at the sound of my voice,
In vessels that sail my words sail, I go with fishermen and seamen and love them.
The soldier camp’d or upon the march is mine,
On the night ere the pending battle many seek me, and I do not fail them,
On that solemn night (it may be their last) those that know me seek me.
My face rubs to the hunter’s face when he lies down alone in his blanket,
The driver thinking of me does not mind the jolt of his wagon,
The young mother and old mother comprehend me,
The girl and the wife rest the needle a moment and forget where they are,
They and all would resume what I have told them.48
I have said that the soul is not more than the body,
And I have said that the body is not more than the soul,
And nothing, not God, is greater to one than one’s self is,
And whoever walks a furlong without sympathy walks to his own funeral drest in his shroud,
And I or you pocketless of a dime may purchase the pick of the earth,
And to glance with an eye or show a bean in its pod confounds the learning of all times,
And there is no trade or employment but the young man following it may become a hero,
And there is no object so soft but it makes a hub for the wheel’d universe,
And I say to any man or woman, Let your soul stand cool and composed before a million universes.
And I say to mankind, Be not curious about God,
For I who am curious about each am not curious about God,
(No array of terms can say how much I am at peace about God and about death.)
I hear and behold God in every object, yet understand God not in the least,
Nor do I understand who there can be more wonderful than myself.
Why should I wish to see God better than this day?
I see something of God each hour of the twenty-four, and each moment then,
In the faces of men and women I see God, and in my own face in the glass,
I find letters from God dropt in the street, and every one is sign’d by God’s name,
And I leave them where they are, for I know that wheresoe’er I go,
Others will punctually come for ever and ever.49
And as to you Death, and you bitter hug of mortality, it is idle to try to alarm me.
To his work without flinching the accoucheur comes,
I see the elder-hand pressing receiving supporting,
I recline by the sills of the exquisite flexible doors,
And mark the outlet, and mark the relief and escape.
And as to you Corpse I think you are good manure, but that does not offend me,
I smell the white roses sweet-scented and growing,
I reach to the leafy lips, I reach to the polish’d breasts of melons.
And as to you Life I reckon you are the leavings of many deaths,
(No doubt I have died myself ten thousand times before.)
I hear you whispering there O stars of heaven,
O suns—O grass of graves—O perpetual transfers and promotions,
If you do not say any thing how can I say any thing?
Of the turbid pool that lies in the autumn forest,
Of the moon that descends the steeps of the soughing twilight,
Toss, sparkles of day and dusk—toss on the black stems that decay in the muck,
Toss to the moaning gibberish of the dry limbs.
I ascend from the moon, I ascend from the night,
I perceive that the ghastly glimmer is noonday sunbeams reflected,
And debouch to the steady and central from the offspring great or small.50
There is that in me—I do not know what it is—but I know it is in me.
Wrench’d and sweaty—calm and cool then my body becomes,
I sleep—I sleep long.
I do not know it—it is without name—it is a word unsaid,
It is not in any dictionary, utterance, symbol.
Something it swings on more than the earth I swing on,
To it the creation is the friend whose embracing awakes me.
Perhaps I might tell more. Outlines! I plead for my brothers and sisters.
Do you see O my brothers and sisters?
It is not chaos or death—it is form, union, plan—it is eternal life—it is Happiness.51
The past and present wilt—I have fill’d them, emptied them,
And proceed to fill my next fold of the future.
Listener up there! what have you to confide to me?
Look in my face while I snuff the sidle of evening,
(Talk honestly, no one else hears you, and I stay only a minute longer.)
Do I contradict myself?
Very well then I contradict myself,
(I am large, I contain multitudes.)
I concentrate toward them that are nigh, I wait on the door-slab.
Who has done his day’s work? who will soonest be through with his supper?
Who wishes to walk with me?
Will you speak before I am gone? will you prove already too late?52
The spotted hawk swoops by and accuses me, he complains of my gab and my loitering.
I too am not a bit tamed, I too am untranslatable,
I sound my barbaric yawp over the roofs of the world.
The last scud of day holds back for me,
It flings my likeness after the rest and true as any on the shadow’d wilds,
It coaxes me to the vapor and the dusk.
I depart as air, I shake my white locks at the runaway sun,
I effuse my flesh in eddies, and drift it in lacy jags.
I bequeath myself to the dirt to grow from the grass I love,
If you want me again look for me under your boot-soles.
You will hardly know who I am or what I mean,
But I shall be good health to you nevertheless,
And filter and fibre your blood.
Failing to fetch me at first keep encouraged,
Missing me one place search another,
I stop somewhere waiting for you.

Without intending to hide, the imagined copperhead hid on the path ahead, unseen on bronze leaves, unheard, and a mortal likelihood   at every step. This was childhood, mine, the wood’s jihad    against a boy who’d intruded among monkshood, wasp, tick, and nettles haired with needles. Scrub brush abhorred him with a horde of  welts, bites, and stings, but he’d never seen a copperhead, though he’d looked hard taking, as he’d been ordered, heed. The snake wasn’t a falsehood, though, to him. Dread was his nature, and he hared through sunlight and shade, head swiveling for the copperhead he’d begun to covet, the ballyhooed killer a camouflaged godhead on which his inborn faith cohered, and his priesthood.

Paradise Regain'd: Book 3 (1671 version)
                ","
SO spake the Son of God, and Satan stood A while as mute confounded what to say, What to reply, confuted and convinc't Of his weak arguing, and fallacious drift; At length collecting all his Serpent wiles, With soothing words renew'd, him thus accosts.    I see thou know'st what is of use to know, What best to say canst say, to do canst do; Thy actions to thy words accord, thy words To thy large heart give utterance due, thy heart Conteins of good, wise, just, the perfect shape. Should Kings and Nations from thy mouth consult, Thy Counsel would be as the Oracle Urim and Thummim, those oraculous gems On Aaron's breast: or tongue of Seers old Infallible; or wert thou sought to deeds That might require th' array of war, thy skill Of conduct would be such, that all the world Could not sustain thy Prowess, or subsist In battel, though against thy few in arms. These God-like Vertues wherefore dost thou hide? Affecting private life, or more obscure In savage Wilderness, wherefore deprive All Earth her wonder at thy acts, thy self The fame and glory, glory the reward That sole excites to high attempts the flame Of most erected Spirits, most temper'd pure Ætherial, who all pleasures else despise, All treasures and all gain esteem as dross, And dignities and powers all but the highest? Thy years are ripe, and over-ripe, the Son Of Macedonian Philip had e're these Won Asia and the Throne of Cyrus held At his dispose, young Scipio had brought down The Carthaginian pride, young Pompey quell'd The Pontic King and in triumph had rode. Yet years, and to ripe years judgment mature, Quench not the thirst of glory, but augment. Great Julius, whom now all the world admires The more he grew in years, the more inflam'd With glory, wept that he had liv'd so long Inglorious: but thou yet art not too late.    To whom our Saviour calmly thus reply'd. Thou neither dost perswade me to seek wealth For Empires sake, nor Empire to affect For glories sake by all thy argument. For what is glory but the blaze of fame, The peoples praise, if always praise unmixt? And what the people but a herd confus'd, A miscellaneous rabble, who extol Things vulgar, & well weigh'd, scarce worth the praise, They praise and they admire they know not what; And know not whom, but as one leads the other; And what delight to be by such extoll'd, To live upon thir tongues and be thir talk, Of whom to be disprais'd were no small praise? His lot who dares be singularly good. Th' intelligent among them and the wise Are few, and glory scarce of few is rais'd. This is true glory and renown, when God Looking on the Earth, with approbation marks The just man, and divulges him through Heaven To all his Angels, who with true applause Recount his praises; thus he did to Job, When to extend his fame through Heaven & Earth, As thou to thy reproach mayst well remember, He ask'd thee, hast thou seen my servant Job? Famous he was in Heaven, on Earth less known; Where glory is false glory, attributed To things not glorious, men not worthy of fame. They err who count it glorious to subdue By Conquest far and wide, to over-run Large Countries, and in field great Battels win, Great Cities by assault: what do these Worthies, But rob and spoil, burn, slaughter, and enslave Peaceable Nations, neighbouring, or remote, Made Captive, yet deserving freedom more Then those thir Conquerours, who leave behind Nothing but ruin wheresoe're they rove, And all the flourishing works of peace destroy, Then swell with pride, and must be titl'd Gods, Great Benefactors of mankind, Deliverers, Worship't with Temple, Priest and Sacrifice; One is the Son of Jove, of Mars the other, Till Conquerour Death discover them scarce men, Rowling in brutish vices, and deform'd, Violent or shameful death thir due reward. But if there be in glory aught of good, It may by means far different be attain'd Without ambition, war, or violence; By deeds of peace, by wisdom eminent, By patience, temperance; I mention still Him whom thy wrongs with Saintly patience born, Made famous in a Land and times obscure; Who names not now with honour patient Job? Poor Socrates (who next more memorable?) By what he taught and suffer'd for so doing, For truths sake suffering death unjust, lives now Equal in fame to proudest Conquerours. Yet if for fame and glory aught be done, Aught suffer'd; if young African for fame His wasted Country freed from Punic rage, The deed becomes unprais'd, the man at least, And loses, though but verbal, his reward. Shall I seek glory then, as vain men seek Oft not deserv'd?   I seek not mine, but his Who sent me, and thereby witness whence I am.    To whom the Tempter murmuring thus reply'd. Think not so slight of glory; therein least Resembling thy great Father: he seeks glory, And for his glory all things made, all things Orders and governs, nor content in Heaven By all his Angels glorifi'd, requires Glory from men, from all men good or bad, Wise or unwise, no difference, no exemption; Above all Sacrifice, or hallow'd gift Glory he requires, and glory he receives Promiscuous from all Nations, Jew, or Greek, Or Barbarous, nor exception hath declar'd; From us his foes pronounc't glory he exacts.    To whom our Saviour fervently reply'd. And reason; since his word all things produc'd, Though chiefly not for glory as prime end, But to shew forth his goodness, and impart His good communicable to every soul Freely; of whom what could he less expect Then glory and benediction, that is thanks, The slightest, easiest, readiest recompence From them who could return him nothing else, And not returning that would likeliest render Contempt instead, dishonour, obloquy? Hard recompence, unsutable return For so much good, so much beneficence. But why should man seek glory? who of his own Hath nothing, and to whom nothing belongs But condemnation, ignominy, and shame? Who for so many benefits receiv'd Turn'd recreant to God, ingrate and false, And so of all true good himself despoil'd, Yet, sacrilegious, to himself would take That which to God alone of right belongs; Yet so much bounty is in God, such grace, That who advance his glory, not thir own, Them he himself to glory will advance.    So spake the Son of God; and here again Satan had not to answer, but stood struck With guilt of his own sin, for he himself Insatiable of glory had lost all, Yet of another Plea bethought him soon.    Of glory as thou wilt, said he, so deem, Worth or not worth the seeking, let it pass: But to a Kingdom thou art born, ordain'd To sit upon thy Father David's Throne; By Mothers side thy Father, though thy right Be now in powerful hands, that will not part Easily from possession won with arms; Judæa now and all the promis'd land Reduc't a Province under Roman yoke, Obeys Tiberius; nor is always rul'd With temperate sway; oft have they violated The Temple, oft the Law with foul affronts, Abominations rather, as did once Antiochus: and think'st thou to regain Thy right by sitting still or thus retiring? So did not Machabeus: he indeed Retir'd unto the Desert, but with arms; And o're a mighty King so oft prevail'd, That by strong hand his Family obtain'd, Though Priests, the Crown, and David's Throne usurp'd, With Modin and her Suburbs once content. If Kingdom move thee not, let move thee Zeal, And Duty; Zeal and Duty are not slow; But on Occasions forelock watchful wait. They themselves rather are occasion best, Zeal of thy Fathers house, Duty to free Thy Country from her Heathen servitude; So shalt thou best fullfil, best verifie The Prophets old, who sung thy endless raign, The happier raign the sooner it begins, Raign then; what canst thou better do the while?    To whom our Saviour answer thus return'd. All things are best fullfil'd in their due time, And time there is for all things, Truth hath said: If of my raign Prophetic Writ hath told, That it shall never end, so when begin The Father in his purpose hath decreed, He in whose hand all times and seasons roul. What if he hath decreed that I shall first Be try'd in humble state, and things adverse, By tribulations, injuries, insults, Contempts, and scorns, and snares, and violence, Suffering, abstaining, quietly expecting Without distrust or doubt, that he may know What I can suffer, how obey? who best Can suffer, best can do; best reign, who first Well hath obey'd; just tryal e're I merit My exaltation without change or end. But what concerns it thee when I begin My everlasting Kingdom, why art thou Sollicitous, what moves thy inquisition? Know'st thou not that my rising is thy fall, And my promotion will be thy destruction?    To whom the Tempter inly rackt reply'd. Let that come when it comes; all hope is lost Of my reception into grace; what worse? For where no hope is left, is left no fear; If there be worse, the expectation more Of worse torments me then the feeling can. I would be at the worst; worst is my Port, My harbour and my ultimate repose, The end I would attain, my final good. My error was my error and my crime My crime; whatever for it self condemn'd, And will alike be punish'd; whether thou Raign or raign not; though to that gentle brow Willingly I could flye, and hope thy raign, From that placid aspect and meek regard, Rather then aggravate my evil state, Would stand between me and thy Fathers ire, (Whose ire I dread more then the fire of Hell) A shelter and a kind of shading cool Interposition, as a summers cloud. If I then to the worst that can be hast, Why move thy feet so slow to what is best, Happiest both to thy self and all the world, That thou who worthiest art should'st be thir King? Perhaps thou linger'st in deep thoughts detain'd Of the enterprize so hazardous and high; No wonder, for though in thee be united What of perfection can in man be found, Or human nature can receive, consider Thy life hath yet been private, most part spent At home, scarce view'd the Gallilean Towns, And once a year Jerusalem, few days Short sojourn; and what thence could'st thou observe? The world thou hast not seen, much less her glory, Empires, and Monarchs, and thir radiant Courts, Best school of best experience, quickest in sight In all things that to greatest actions lead. The wisest, unexperienc't, will be ever Timorous and loth, with novice modesty, (As he who seeking Asses found a Kingdom) Irresolute, unhardy, unadventrous: But I will bring thee where thou soon shalt quit Those rudiments, and see before thine eyes The Monarchies of the Earth, thir pomp and state, Sufficient introduction to inform Thee, of thy self so apt, in regal Arts, And regal Mysteries; that thou may'st know How best their opposition to withstand.    With that (such power was giv'n him then) he took The Son of God up to a Mountain high. It was a Mountain at whose verdant feet A spatious plain out stretch't in circuit wide Lay pleasant; from his side two rivers flow'd, Th' one winding, the other strait and left between Fair Champain with less rivers interveind, Then meeting joyn'd thir tribute to the Sea: Fertil of corn the glebe, of oyl and wine, With herds the pastures throng'd, with flocks the hills, Huge Cities and high towr'd, that well might seem The seats of mightiest Monarchs, and so large The Prospect was, that here and there was room For barren desert fountainless and dry. To this high mountain top the Tempter brought Our Saviour, and new train of words began.    Well have we speeded, and o're hill and dale, Forest and field, and flood, Temples and Towers Cut shorter many a league; here thou behold'st Assyria and her Empires antient bounds, Araxes and the Caspian lake, thence on As far as Indus East, Euphrates West, And oft beyond; to South the Persian Bay, And inaccessible the Arabian drouth: Here Ninevee, of length within her wall Several days journey, built by Ninus old, Of that first golden Monarchy the seat, And seat of Salmanassar, whose success Israel in long captivity still mourns; There Babylon the wonder of all tongues, As antient, but rebuilt by him who twice Judah and all thy Father David's house Led captive, and Jerusalem laid waste, Till Cyrus set them free; Persepolis His City there thou seest, and Bactra there; Ecbatana her structure vast there shews, And Hecatompylos her hunderd gates, There Susa by Choaspes, amber stream, The drink of none but Kings; of later fame Built by Emathian, or by Parthian hands, The great Seleucia, Nisibis, and there Artaxata, Teredon, Tesiphon, Turning with easie eye thou may'st behold. All these the Parthian, now some Ages past, By great Arsaces led, who founded first That Empire, under his dominion holds From the luxurious Kings of Antioch won. And just in time thou com'st to have a view Of his great power; for now the Parthian King In Ctesiphon hath gather'd all his Host Against the Scythian, whose incursions wild Have wasted Sogdiana; to her aid He marches now in hast; see, though from far, His thousands, in what martial equipage They issue forth, Steel Bows, and Shafts their arms Of equal dread in flight, or in pursuit; All Horsemen, in which fight they most excel; See how in warlike muster they appear, In Rhombs and wedges, and half moons, and wings.    He look't and saw what numbers numberless The City gates out powr'd, light armed Troops In coats of Mail and military pride; In Mail thir horses clad, yet fleet and strong, Prauncing their riders bore, the flower and choice Of many Provinces from bound to bound; From Arachosia, from Candaor East, And Margiana to the Hyrcanian cliffs Of Caucasus, and dark Iberian dales, From Atropatia and the neighbouring plains Of Adiabene, Media, and the South Of Susiana to Balsara's hav'n. He saw them in thir forms of battell rang'd, How quick they wheel'd, and flying behind them shot Sharp sleet of arrowie showers against the face Of thir pursuers, and overcame by flight; The field all iron cast a gleaming brown, Nor wanted clouds of foot, nor on each horn, Cuirassiers all in steel for standing fight; Chariots or Elephants endorst with Towers Of Archers, nor of labouring Pioners A multitude with Spades and Axes arm'd To lay hills plain, fell woods, or valleys fill, Or where plain was raise hill, or over-lay With bridges rivers proud, as with a yoke; Mules after these, Camels and Dromedaries, And Waggons fraught with Utensils of war. Such forces met not, nor so wide a camp, When Agrican with all his Northern powers Besieg'd Albracca, as Romances tell; The City of Gallaphrone, from thence to win The fairest of her Sex Angelica His daughter, sought by many Prowest Knights, Both Paynim, and the Peers of Charlemane. Such and so numerous was thir Chivalrie; At sight whereof the Fiend yet more presum'd, And to our Saviour thus his words renew'd.    That thou may'st know I seek not to engage Thy Vertue, and not every way secure On no slight grounds thy safety; hear, and mark To what end I have brought thee hither and shewn All this fair sight; thy Kingdom though foretold By Prophet or by Angel, unless thou Endeavour, as thy Father David did, Thou never shalt obtain; prediction still In all things, and all men, supposes means, Without means us'd, what it predicts revokes. But say thou wer't possess'd of David's Throne By free consent of all, none opposite, Samaritan or Jew; how could'st thou hope Long to enjoy it quiet and secure, Between two such enclosing enemies Roman and Parthian? therefore one of these Thou must make sure thy own, the Parthian first By my advice, as nearer and of late Found able by invasion to annoy Thy country, and captive lead away her Kings Antigonus, and old Hyrcanus bound, Maugre the Roman: it shall be my task To render thee the Parthian at dispose; Chuse which thou wilt by conquest or by league. By him thou shalt regain, without him not, That which alone can truly reinstall thee In David's royal seat, his true Successour, Deliverance of thy brethren, those ten Tribes Whose off-spring in his Territory yet serve In Habor, and among the Medes dispers't, Ten Sons of Jacob, two of Joseph lost Thus long from Israel; serving as of old Thir Fathers in the land of Egypt serv'd, This offer sets before thee to deliver. These if from servitude thou shalt restore To thir inheritance, then, nor till then, Thou on the Throne of David in full glory, From Egypt to Euphrates and beyond Shalt raign, and Rome or Caesar not need fear.    To whom our Saviour answer'd thus unmov'd. Much ostentation vain of fleshly arm, And fragile arms, much instrument of war Long in preparing, soon to nothing brought, Before mine eyes thou hast set; and in my ear Vented much policy, and projects deep Of enemies, of aids, battels and leagues, Plausible to the world, to me worth naught. Means I must use thou say'st, prediction else Will unpredict and fail me of the Throne: My time I told thee, (and that time for thee Were better farthest off) is not yet come,; When that comes think not thou to find me slack On my part aught endeavouring, or to need Thy politic maxims, or that cumbersome Luggage of war there shewn me, argument Of human weakness rather then of strength. My brethren, as thou call'st them; those Ten Tribes I must deliver, if I mean to raign David's true heir, and his full Scepter sway To just extent over all Israel's Sons; But whence to thee this zeal, where was it then For Israel, or for David, or his Throne, When thou stood'st up his Tempter to the pride Of numbring Israel, which cost the lives Of threescore and ten thousand Israelites By three days Pestilence? such was thy zeal To Israel then, the same that now to me. As for those captive Tribes, themselves were they Who wrought their own captivity, fell off From God to worship Calves, the Deities Of Egypt, Baal next and Ashtaroth, And all the Idolatries of Heathen round, Besides thir other worse then heathenish crimes; Nor in the land of their captivity Humbled themselves, or penitent besought The God of their fore-fathers; but so dy'd Impenitent, and left a race behind Like to themselves, distinguishable scarce From Gentils, but by Circumcision vain, And God with Idols in their worship joyn'd. Should I of these the liberty regard, Who freed, as to their antient Patrimony, Unhumbl'd, unrepentant, unreform'd, Headlong would follow; and to thir Gods perhaps Of Bethel and of Dan? no, let them serve Thir enemies, who serve Idols with God. Yet he at length, time to himself best known, Remembring Abraham by some wond'rous call May bring them back repentant and sincere, And at their passing cleave the Assyrian flood, While to their native land with joy they hast, As the Red Sea and Jordan once he cleft, When to the promis'd land thir Fathers pass'd; To his due time and providence I leave them.    So spake Israel's true King, and to the Fiend Made answer meet, that made void all his wiles. So fares it when with truth falshood contends.

Miracles Attending Israel’s Journey



When Isr’el, freed from Pharaoh’s hand, Left the proud tyrant and his land, The tribes with cheerful homage own Their king; and Judah was his throne. Across the deep their journey lay; The deep divides to make them way. Jordan beheld their march, and led, With backward current, to his head. The mountains shook like frighted sheep, Like lambs the little hillocks leap; Not Sinai on her base could stand, Conscious of sov’reign pow’r at hand. What pow’r could make the deep divide? Make Jordan backward roll his tide? Why did ye leap, ye little hills? And whence the fright that Sinai feels? Let ev’ry mountain, ev’ry flood, Retire and know th’ approaching God, The King of Isr’el: see him here! Tremble, thou earth, adore and fear. He thunders, and all nature mourns; The rock to standing pools he turns, Flints spring with fountains at his word, And fires and seas confess the Lord.

A wanderer is man from his birth.He was born in a shipOn the breast of the river of Time;Brimming with wonder and joyHe spreads out his arms to the light,Rivets his gaze on the banks of the stream.As what he sees is, so have his thoughts been.Whether he wakes,Where the snowy mountainous pass,Echoing the screams of the eagles,Hems in its gorges the bedOf the new-born clear-flowing stream;Whether he first sees lightWhere the river in gleaming ringsSluggishly winds through the plain;Whether in sound of the swallowing sea—As is the world on the banks,So is the mind of the man.
    Vainly does each, as he glides,Fable and dreamOf the lands which the river of TimeHad left ere he woke on its breast,Or shall reach when his eyes have been closed.Only the tract where he sailsHe wots of; only the thoughts,Raised by the objects he passes, are his.Who can see the green earth any moreAs she was by the sources of Time?Who imagines her fields as they layIn the sunshine, unworn by the plough?Who thinks as they thought,The tribes who then roam'd on her breast,Her vigorous, primitive sons?What girlNow reads in her bosom as clearAs Rebekah read, when she sateAt eve by the palm-shaded well?Who guards in her breastAs deep, as pellucid a springOf feeling, as tranquil, as sure?
    What bard,At the height of his vision, can deemOf God, of the world, of the soul,With a plainness as near,As flashing as Moses feltWhen he lay in the night by his flockOn the starlit Arabian waste?Can rise and obeyThe beck of the Spirit like him?This tract which the river of TimeNow flows through with us, is the plain.Gone is the calm of its earlier shore.Border'd by cities and hoarseWith a thousand cries is its stream.And we on its breast, our mindsAre confused as the cries which we hear,Changing and shot as the sights which we see.And we say that repose has fledFor ever the course of the river of Time.That cities will crowd to its edgeIn a blacker, incessanter line;That the din will be more on its banks,Denser the trade on its stream,Flatter the plain where it flows,Fiercer the sun overhead.That never will those on its breastSee an ennobling sight,Drink of the feeling of quiet again.But what was before us we know not,And we know not what shall succeed.Haply, the river of Time—As it grows, as the towns on its margeFling their wavering lightsOn a wider, statelier stream—May acquire, if not the calmOf its early mountainous shore,Yet a solemn peace of its own.And the width of the waters, the hushOf the grey expanse where he floats,Freshening its current and spotted with foamAs it draws to the Ocean, may strikePeace to the soul of the man on its breast—As the pale waste widens around him,As the banks fade dimmer away,As the stars come out, and the night-windBrings up the streamMurmurs and scents of the infinite sea.

So I spake unto the people in the morning: and at even my wife died; and I did in the morning as I was commanded.
— Ezekiel 24:18



She is approaching him, God, he sees her
in his eye-edge, a tiny gold speck
getting bigger, scintillating. Her beauty
lashes him with its sword —
but she has heard all this before.
She approaches him, the one who killed her,
and she reeks of life.
He waits for her to dissolve in him, but her grit
encircles his teeth.
He waits for her to become
what he has made her, an angel, passionate
and cold as the dawn,
quietly encased in power,
churning out neutral love and fastened to eternity,
backwards and forwards all the days.
But the world is tangled in her hair.
She is getting closer
and her gold beauty is greening, her face is turning
furious, fury-like, her death
opens around him
and he feels a human fear.
He cannot match her, she has the reins
of creation in her slim white paws, he feels the world
creeping away from him. He makes
to shove her from heaven, let her slip and slumber through the world.
But he cannot grip her.
She gleams through him like heaven through a needle.
 
 the stroll 
God takes Ezekiel for many walks.
He talks about all the things he will do to the people,
this and this and this, and then
they will know who I am.
One day they chance upon a valley of bones
splintering and whitening in the sun.
Shall these bones live? These
bones? Oh Lord. God flings
sinew on the bones, liver, spleen, gristle.
The bodies rise.
Rise without breath, wet clay
glistens in the sun.
He gives breath, as if an afterthought.
Ezekiel tries to see in their eyes, one at a time.
The men not moving but lunging forward like warriors,
eyes ice cold mud seen through mist,
waiting for their souls to snap back in.
They are bruised with an ache
made not by the world.
Their forgotten stories rift their faces,
their deaths now a hole they can walk through.
Home a space that closed after them, rinsed of
the mourning that ran its course.
They glimmer in new reality, still speechless,
as if they were really the miracle ...
But already God has taken Ezekiel by the elbow.

Sometimes it takes miles to give up resistance,
though the mirror shows a body unresisting, shows
perhaps something to admire. Others may.
A body without difficulty loosening, breaking
its own willfulness, cracking itself
like a rusted bolt that finally begins to turn.
A body that turns. Toward openness, fantasy,
those desires of and not of the body. Sometimes
I notice a powerful man engaged steadily
repeating difficult action: folding himself, his tight
skin, over and over, lifting a declined torso
or pulling up a suspended trunk, and think,
how neat, how controlled to be inside that body.
I struggle not to stare, grip myself not to lose myself
inside the thought of being inside that body.
I can never get there I know because it is
the image I want, the veneer of muscle
having taken primacy from mind, now first
among equals: bicep, abdominal, quadricep,
the launch after launch of a perpetual run.
I want the image even when I am it, or nearly it—
because even then, I am also that other thing,
self-conscious, burdened, struggling for movement.
If there is a link between God and animals—
the way He identifies with the so much
that isn’t us, as He had to have, to have made them—
it must be in the body enacting will immediate
through movement, as if with a word
creating a world (enacting creation immediate
through speech). Which is to say, this is my time
of prayer, my only time: miles in, as long
as it takes for the body to relinquish resistance.
Bright, public, surrounded by others who move
toward better movement. And all the while seeing
in a wall of mirrors that image of myself, deer,
horse, running close kin to breathing, motion
necessary to survival, perfect image of a man
that I’m merely a self-conscious copy of.
I pray for things, of course, for myself
and for those whose pain touches me, selfish
and unselfish prayers for intimates and strangers.
I pray for the runner in the mirror, too, sleek, easy
animal, unselfconscious and present, and absent
as a god, the man who could almost be me,
who I do my best to rush toward. I pray that
one day, by His grace, we may meet.

I don’t wear a mask (God hates carnival) but a wool hood, Holy Week’s, that Sister Rose knitted by the charcoal altar, her wooden teeth clacking as she hymned in Latin, the moles on her jowl like prickly pears for penance. My own teeth are those grates that grilled the martyrs, & my little lamb’s ears quiver each afternoon when the wind coughs in fits and pale skies smoke with incense from a clandestine Mass, perhaps on a runaway shallop with sails sewn from stolen cassocks, perhaps on a newborn isle with a thatched church, novices crawling like iguanas around stations of the cross. There’s no home for orphans like us raised in a convent by the wharf where the footless angel blows his trumpet for vesper, and the abbess marches us to the clapboard altar when the cock crows. We sleep in straw cubbies, our sheets those crinkled newspapers that swaddled us like groupers in the foundling’s basket. Hey, you, girl with the twisted neck, your dollhouse will keep on shrinking between your dirty legs. Not even holy water can make you clean. Hey, boy, the more you pull on the kite, the more your house of dreams will get lost in summer’s wayward clouds. Let us live in the meadow, our true home, every bush a hearth, every pond a font: O blessed loam of nettles whose fireflies light the shrine at night, whose blue brooks spread out like veins of  Calvary.

                               Where are the days of Tobias,
when one of you, veiling his radiance, stood at the front door,
slightly disguised for the journey, no longer appalling.
— Rainer Maria Rilke, tr. by Stephen Mitchell



The fresco cracks cooperatively over time. Not to give a secret away
but gradually to break off keeping it. In the sky you make birds
like this, one wing longer than the other, an asymmetrical v
wedged against wind, one stroke longer than another,
never the bodies turned the same direction, each finding
its own angle, and one, in the distance,
a dot. These are the Deadly Birds of the Soul
Rilke was forced to call terrifying.
Migratory, weighing no more than a pencil.
Because every flying thing is passionate, and every flight
a posture torn from stone.
There was a time it was a theme
parents would pay an artist to realize — the face of a beloved son,
a Luca or Piero, painted onto the shoulders of Tobias,
painted into the company of Raphael. You tell yourselves
and your quiet house
no harm will come to the boy
as he goes out. A guardian, though, is not a guard. To keep safe
is subtly different from confining. Radiance can strategically
direct itself to seem like us, ready, as it were, to walk.
As a mirror goes through the appearance of requiring
subsistence, goes through the motions of a meal
whose food appears to be food.
Radiance, we know, is never quite as warm as light.
Who has not tasted the silver in sea mist?
Whosever they are, angels are the first to surface there.
You know a guardian by the silver of a river-crossing,
of a father’s filmy eyes, in gall, heart, fire,
and mostly smoke. In smoke and mostly mirror.
As, wedged between forward and backward being,
rehashing and planning ahead, presence will be specked again
with being erased, a reusable writing surface
calling down to the life without rest, the self-propelled
surveillances of sharks.

On the way to the village store   
I drive through a down-draft   
from the neighbor’s chimney.   
Woodsmoke tumbles from the eaves

of the fire and sulfur of Grandmother’s   
vengeful God, the one who disapproves
of jeans and shorts for girls,
dancing, strong waters, and adultery.
A moment later the smoke enters
the car, although the windows are tight,   
insinuating that I might, like Judas,
and the foolish virgins, and the rich
young man, have been made for unquenchable   
fire. God will need something to burn
if the fire is to be unquenchable.

Coldly, sadly descendsThe autumn-evening. The fieldStrewn with its dank yellow driftsOf wither'd leaves, and the elms,Fade into dimness apace,Silent;—hardly a shoutFrom a few boys late at their play!The lights come out in the street,In the school-room windows;—but cold,Solemn, unlighted, austere,Through the gathering darkness, ariseThe chapel-walls, in whose boundThou, my father! art laid.There thou dost lie, in the gloomOf the autumn evening. But ah! That word, gloom, to my mindBrings thee back, in the lightOf thy radiant vigour, again;In the gloom of November we pass'dDays not dark at thy side;Seasons impair'd not the rayOf thy buoyant cheerfulness clear.Such thou wast! and I standIn the autumn evening, and thinkOf bygone autumns with thee.Fifteen years have gone roundSince thou arosest to tread,In the summer-morning, the roadOf death, at a call unforeseen,Sudden. For fifteen years,We who till then in thy shadeRested as under the boughsOf a mighty oak, have enduredSunshine and rain as we might,Bare, unshaded, alone,Lacking the shelter of thee.O strong soul, by what shoreTarriest thou now? For that force,Surely, has not been left vain!Somewhere, surely afar,In the sounding labour-house vastOf being, is practised that strength,Zealous, beneficent, firm!Yes, in some far-shining sphere,Conscious or not of the past,Still thou performest the wordOf the Spirit in whom thou dost live—Prompt, unwearied, as here!Still thou upraisest with zealThe humble good from the ground,Sternly repressest the bad!Still, like a trumpet, dost rouseThose who with half-open eyesTread the border-land dim'Twixt vice and virtue; reviv'st,Succourest!—this was thy work,This was thy life upon earth.What is the course of the lifeOf mortal men on the earth?—Most men eddy aboutHere and there—eat and drink,Chatter and love and hate,Gather and squander, are raisedAloft, are hurl'd in the dust,Striving blindly, achievingNothing; and then they die—Perish;—and no one asksWho or what they have been,More than he asks what waves,In the moonlit solitudes mildOf the midmost Ocean, have swell'd,Foam'd for a moment, and gone.And there are some, whom a thirstArdent, unquenchable, fires,Not with the crowd to be spent,Not without aim to go roundIn an eddy of purposeless dust,Effort unmeaning and vain.Ah yes! some of us striveNot without action to dieFruitless, but something to snatchFrom dull oblivion, nor allGlut the devouring grave!We, we have chosen our path—Path to a clear-purposed goal,Path of advance!—but it leadsA long, steep journey, through sunkGorges, o'er mountains in snow.Cheerful, with friends, we set forth—Then on the height, comes the storm.Thunder crashes from rockTo rock, the cataracts reply,Lightnings dazzle our eyes.Roaring torrents have breach'dThe track, the stream-bed descendsIn the place where the wayfarer oncePlanted his footstep—the sprayBoils o'er its borders! aloftThe unseen snow-beds dislodgeTheir hanging ruin; alas,Havoc is made in our train!Friends, who set forth at our side,Falter, are lost in the storm.We, we only are left!With frowning foreheads, with lipsSternly compress'd, we strain on,On—and at nightfall at lastCome to the end of our way,To the lonely inn 'mid the rocks;Where the gaunt and taciturn hostStands on the threshold, the windShaking his thin white hairs—Holds his lantern to scanOur storm-beat figures, and asks:Whom in our party we bring?Whom we have left in the snow?Sadly we answer: We bringOnly ourselves! we lostSight of the rest in the storm.Hardly ourselves we fought through,Stripp'd, without friends, as we are.Friends, companions, and train,The avalanche swept from our side.But thou woulds't not alone Be saved, my father! alone Conquer and come to thy goal,Leaving the rest in the wild.We were weary, and weFearful, and we in our marchFain to drop down and to die.Still thou turnedst, and stillBeckonedst the trembler, and stillGavest the weary thy hand.If, in the paths of the world,Stones might have wounded thy feet,Toil or dejection have triedThy spirit, of that we sawNothing—to us thou wage stillCheerful, and helpful, and firm!Therefore to thee it was givenMany to save with thyself;And, at the end of thy day,O faithful shepherd! to come,Bringing thy sheep in thy hand.And through thee I believeIn the noble and great who are gone;Pure souls honour'd and blestBy former ages, who else—Such, so soulless, so poor,Is the race of men whom I see—Seem'd but a dream of the heart,Seem'd but a cry of desire.Yes! I believe that there livedOthers like thee in the past,Not like the men of the crowdWho all round me to-dayBluster or cringe, and make lifeHideous, and arid, and vile;But souls temper'd with fire,Fervent, heroic, and good,Helpers and friends of mankind.Servants of God!—or sonsShall I not call you? BecauseNot as servants ye knewYour Father's innermost mind,His, who unwillingly seesOne of his little ones lost—Yours is the praise, if mankindHath not as yet in its marchFainted, and fallen, and died!See! In the rocks of the worldMarches the host of mankind,A feeble, wavering line.Where are they tending?—A GodMarshall'd them, gave them their goal.Ah, but the way is so long!Years they have been in the wild!Sore thirst plagues them, the rocksRising all round, overawe;Factions divide them, their hostThreatens to break, to dissolve.—Ah, keep, keep them combined!Else, of the myriads who fillThat army, not one shall arrive;Sole they shall stray; in the rocksStagger for ever in vain,Die one by one in the waste.Then, in such hour of needOf your fainting, dispirited race,Ye, like angels, appear,Radiant with ardour divine!Beacons of hope, ye appear!Languor is not in your heart,Weakness is not in your word,Weariness not on your brow.Ye alight in our van! at your voice,Panic, despair, flee away.Ye move through the ranks, recallThe stragglers, refresh the outworn,Praise, re-inspire the brave!Order, courage, return.Eyes rekindling, and prayers,Follow your steps as ye go.Ye fill up the gaps in our files,Strengthen the wavering line,Stablish, continue our march,On, to the bound of the waste,On, to the City of God.

What matter if the ditches are impure?
What matter if I live it all once more?
Endure that toil of growing up;
The ignominy of boyhood; the distress
Of boyhood changing into man;
The unfinished man and his pain
Brought face to face with his own clumsiness;
The finished man among his enemies?—
How in the name of Heaven can he escape
That defiling and disfigured shape
The mirror of malicious eyes
Casts upon his eyes until at last
He thinks that shape must be his shape?
And what's the good of an escape
If honour find him in the wintry blast?
I am content to live it all again
And yet again, if it be life to pitch
Into the frog-spawn of a blind man's ditch,
A blind man battering blind men;
Or into that most fecund ditch of all,
The folly that man does
Or must suffer, if he woos
A proud woman not kindred of his soul.
I am content to follow to its source
Every event in action or in thought;
Measure the lot; forgive myself the lot!
When such as I cast out remorse
So great a sweetness flows into the breast
We must laugh and we must sing,
We are blest by everything,
Everything we look upon is blest.

The nest was at rest for a time, not being
made. Before the eggs were laid, it softened.
The robin sleeping. Inside the house,
the sound of laundry
in the dryer, the sound of a zipper
tumbling inside
the apparatus, and shirts with buttons,
as well as napkins
and a tablecloth printed with blueberries
and stalks of lily of the valley, oval,
for the table with claw legs
and extra leaves for guests.

In one account, the angels come, their hands
emerging from their wings like sentences
staying, as long as it takes,
for the windows to go from indigo
to black, as long
as it takes for a breath to land in the base
of the belly, in the cavity
wisdom tells us wisdom comes from
or first dwells in, before it navigates
the narrows of the throat, becomes mantra,
becomes guttural, becomes spit to aspirate
the language the mouth makes.
The native obligation of this account
to its subject is care. The form
of music the wind chime makes
registers the commitment
of a furious system, filled with
conviction, to the continued
transformation of what
is. Do not ask what has been
lost. Ask what changed. An instrument
of will, the guitar echoes this, a chord,
more reminder than absolute, the hand
arouses but does not create the scale.
In this way what rests gets taken up.
III. 
In another, the mind makes a decision
to end its disorder. The mind wants first
to end the face. The subject
has had enough, one too many
figures walking through the orchard, the call
and response of conversation
become an imposition on some other world
unbroken by the idea of separate bodies,
an idea one has never been convinced of,
and so now it is a relief to believe
what one has suspected, that separation
a trick of perspective, though such a revelation
does not undo the fatigue of existing
in the continuing illusions of others. And yet, the obligation
to be kind, to show interest in strangers
when they visit with flowers, to family
whose hands are empty, and to doctors,
not to mention the pain.
IV. 
In the last account, the explosions
are too small to be seen, and oxygen
takes both thirst and hunger away
as it ceases to find a home in the lungs,
and the patient, having ceased to feel, ceases
to breathe, as the heart shuts down
before the brain and shuts

See how the orient dew, Shed from the bosom of the morn      Into the blowing roses, Yet careless of its mansion new, For the clear region where ’twas born      Round in itself incloses:    And in its little globe’s extent, Frames as it can its native element.    How it the purple flow’r does slight,         Scarce touching where it lies,    But gazing back upon the skies,         Shines with a mournful light,          Like its own tear, Because so long divided from the sphere.    Restless it rolls and unsecure,       Trembling lest it grow impure,    Till the warm sun pity its pain,   And to the skies exhale it back again.       So the soul, that drop, that ray   Of the clear fountain of eternal day,   Could it within the human flow’r be seen,       Remembering still its former height,       Shuns the sweet leaves and blossoms green,       And recollecting its own light, Does, in its pure and circling thoughts, express The greater heaven in an heaven less.         In how coy a figure wound,         Every way it turns away:         So the world excluding round,         Yet receiving in the day,       Dark beneath, but bright above,       Here disdaining, there in love.    How loose and easy hence to go,    How girt and ready to ascend,    Moving but on a point below,    It all about does upwards bend. Such did the manna’s sacred dew distill,   White and entire, though congealed and chill,   Congealed on earth : but does, dissolving, run   Into the glories of th’ almighty sun.

I am poor brother Lippo, by your leave!
You need not clap your torches to my face.Zooks,Zooks! word of emphasis, from “Gadzooks”, as in “God’s hooks” – referring to the nails that held Christ to the Cross what's to blame? you think you see a monk!
What, 'tis past midnight, and you go the rounds,
And here you catch me at an alley's end
Where sportivesportive amorous in nature, wanton ladies leave their doors ajar?
The Carmine'sCarmine’s Convent of the Carmine, where Lippi was placed at the age of eight. my cloister: hunt it up,
Do,—harry outharry out drive off, if you must show your zeal,
Whatever rat, there, haps on his wrong hole,
And nip each softlingsoftling “a soft little hand” [OED] of a wee white mouse,Weke, weke, that's crept to keep him company!
Aha, you know your betters! Then, you'll take
Your hand away that's fiddling on my throat,
And please to know me likewise. Who am I?
Why, one, sir, who is lodging with a friend
Three streets off—he's a certain . . . how d'ye call?
Master—a ...Cosimo of the MediciCosimo of the Medici 1389-1464, Florentine politician and patron of the arts, who supported Lippi ,
I' the house that caps the corner. Boh! you were best!
Remember and tell me, the day you're hanged,
How you affected such a gullet's-gripe!
But you, sir, it concerns you that your knaves
Pick up a manner nor discredit you:
Zooks, are we pilchardspilchards small sea fish, that they sweep the streets
And count fair price what comes into their net?
He's Judas to a tittleto a tittle to a T, that man is!
Just such a face! Why, sir, you make amends.
Lord, I'm not angry! Bid your hang-dogshang-dogs despicable people go
Drink out this quarter-florin to the health
Of the munificent House that harbours me
(And many more beside, lads! more beside!)
And all's come square again. I'd like his face—
His, elbowing on his comrade in the door
With the pike and lantern,—for the slave that holdsJohn Baptist's head a-dangle by the hairWith one hand (""Look you, now,"" as who should say)And his weapon in the other, yet unwiped!John Baptist’s head a-dangle … unwiped John the Baptist was a New Testament prophet who baptized Jesus; see Matthew 3. The “Beheading of the Baptist” and “Banquet of Herod” are two works by Lippi (both in Prato) on the theme of John the Baptist’s end at Herod’s hands.
It's not your chance to have a bit of chalk,
A wood-coal or the like? or you should see!
Yes, I'm the painter, since you style me so.
What, brother Lippo's doings, up and down,
You know them and they take you? like enough!
I saw the proper twinkle in your eye—
'Tell you, I liked your looks at very first.
Let's sit and set things straight now, hip to haunch.
Here's spring come, and the nights one makes up bands
To roam the town and sing out carnivalcarnival riotous season prior to the austerity of Lent,
And I've been three weeks shut within my mewmew figuratively speaking, a cage,
A-painting for the great man, saints and saints
And saints again. I could not paint all night—
Ouf! I leaned out of window for fresh air.
There came a hurry of feet and little feet,
A sweep of lute strings, laughs, and whiftswhifts bits of a song of song, —Flower o' the broom,Take away love, and our earth is a tomb!Flower o' the quince,I let Lisa go, and what good in life since?Flower o' the thyme—and so on. Round they went.
Scarce had they turned the corner when a titter
Like the skipping of rabbits by moonlight,—three slim shapes,
And a face that looked up . . . zooks, sir, flesh and blood,
That's all I'm made of! Into shreds it went,
Curtain and counterpane and coverlet,
All the bed-furniture—a dozen knots,
There was a ladder! Down I let myself,
Hands and feet, scrambling somehow, and so dropped,
And after them. I came up with the fun
Hard by Saint LaurenceSaint Laurence a church in Florence: S. Lorenzo in Vasari. Lippi painted an Annunciation scene here, hail fellow, well met,—Flower o' the rose,If I've been merry, what matter who knows?

You snap me of the sudden. Ah, I see!
Though your eye twinkles still, you shake your head—
Mine's shaved—a monk, you say—the sting 's in that!
If Master Cosimo announced himself,
Mum's the word naturally; but a monk!
Come, what am I a beast for? tell us, now!
I was a baby when my mother died
And father died and left me in the street.
I starved there, God knows how, a year or two
On fig-skins, melon-parings, rinds and shucks,
Refuse and rubbish. One fine frosty day,
My stomach being empty as your hat,
The wind doubled me up and down I went.
Old Aunt LapacciaAunt Lapaccia Filippo’s aunt, who cared for him after his father died trussed me with one hand,
(Its fellow was a stinger as I knew)
And so along the wall, over the bridge,
By the straight cut to the convent. Six words there,
While I stood munching my first bread that month:
""So, boy, you're minded,"" quoth the good fat father
Wiping his own mouth, 'twas refection-time,—
""To quit this very miserable world?
Will you renounce"" . . . ""the mouthful of bread?"" thought I;
By no means! Brief, they made a monk of me;
I did renounce the world, its pride and greed,
Palace, farm, villa, shop, and banking-house,
Trash, such as these poor devils of Medici
Have given their hearts to—all at eight years old.
Well, sir, I found in time, you may be sure,
'Twas not for nothing—the good bellyful,
The warm serge and the rope that goes all round,
And day-long blessed idleness beside!
""Let's see what the urchin's fit for""—that came next.
Not overmuch their way, I must confess.
Such a to-do! They tried me with their books:
Lord, they'd have taught me Latin in pure waste!Flower o' the clove.All the Latin I construe is, ""amo"" I love!
But, mind you, when a boy starves in the streets
Eight years together, as my fortune was,
Watching folk's faces to know who will fling
The bit of half-stripped grape-bunch he desires,
And who will curse or kick him for his pains,—
Which gentleman processional and fine,
Holding a candle to the Sacrament,
Will wink and let him lift a plate and catch
The droppings of the wax to sell again,
Or holla for the Eightthe Eight “the magistrates of Florence” [Ian Jack]  and have him whipped,—
How say I?—nay, which dog bites, which lets drop
His bone from the heap of offal in the street,—
Why, soul and sense of him grow sharp alike,
He learns the look of things, and none the less
For admonition from the hunger-pinch.
I had a store of such remarks, be sure,
Which, after I found leisure, turned to use.
I drew men's faces on my copy-books,
Scrawled them within the antiphonary's margeantiphonary’s marge margin of an antiphon (a book of chants used during Mass),
Joined legs and arms to the long music-notes,
Found eyes and nose and chin for A's and B's,
And made a string of pictures of the world
Betwixt the ins and outs of verb and noun,
On the wall, the bench, the door. The monks looked black.
""Nay,"" quoth the Prior, ""turn him out, d'ye say?
In no wise. Lose a crow and catch a lark.
What if at last we get our man of parts,
We CarmelitesCarmelites an order of mendicant friars, founded at Mount Carmel in the 12th Century; also called White Friars, like those CamaldoleseCamaldolese member of the religious order founded in the 11th Century also called Camaldolites

And put the front on it that ought to be!""
And hereupon he bade me daub away.
Thank you! my head being crammed, the walls a blank,
Never was such prompt disemburdeningdisemburdening disburdening.
First, every sort of monk, the black and whitethe black and the white Black Friars are Dominicans; White Friars are Carmelites,
I drew them, fat and lean: then, folk at church,
From good old gossips waiting to confess
Their cribscribs minor thefts of barrel-droppings, candle-ends,—
To the breathless fellow at the altar-foot,
Fresh from his murder, safe and sitting there
With the little children round him in a row
Of admiration, half for his beard and half
For that white anger of his victim's son
Shaking a fist at him with one fierce arm,
Signing himself with the other because of Christ
(Whose sad face on the cross sees only this
After the passion of a thousand years)
Till some poor girl, her apron o'er her head,
(Which the intense eyes looked through) came at eve
On tiptoe, said a word, dropped in a loaf,
Her pair of earrings and a bunch of flowers
(The brute took growling), prayed, and so was gone.
I painted all, then cried ""'Tis ask and have;
Choose, for more's ready!""—laid the ladder flat,
And showed my covered bit of cloister-wall.
The monks closed in a circle and praised loud
Till checked, taught what to see and not to see,
Being simple bodies,—""That's the very man!
Look at the boy who stoops to pat the dog!
That woman's like the Prior's niecePrior’s niece euphemism for an intimate of the Prior who comes
To care about his asthma: it's the life!''
But there my triumph's straw-fire flared and funkedfunked went out, smoked;
Their betters took their turn to see and say:
The Prior and the learned pulled a face
And stopped all that in no time. ""How? what's here?
Quite from the mark of painting, bless us all!
Faces, arms, legs, and bodies like the true
As much as pea and pea! it's devil's-game!
Your business is not to catch men with show,
With homage to the perishable clay,
But lift them over it, ignore it all,
Make them forget there's such a thing as flesh.
Your business is to paint the souls of men—
Man's soul, and it's a fire, smoke . . . no, it's not . . .
It's vapour done up like a new-born babe—
(In that shape when you die it leaves your mouth)
It's . . . well, what matters talking, it's the soul!
Give us no more of body than shows soul!
Here's GiottoGiotto Florentine painter, Giotto di Bondone (1266/67-1337) [Metropolitan Museum site] (For an example of his work, see here.), with his Saint a-praising God,
That sets us praising—why not stop with him?
Why put all thoughts of praise out of our head
With wonder at lines, colours, and what not?
Paint the soul, never mind the legs and arms!
Rub all out, try at it a second time.
Oh, that white smallish female with the breasts,
She's just my niece . . . HerodiasHerodias Herod’s second wife, see Matthew 14:1-12. Her daughter Salome dances before Herod, who afterwards grants her whatever she will wish.   At the suggestion of Herodias, Salome asks for John the Baptist’s head.   Lippi’s “Banquet of Herod” (in Prato) shows this scene of the Baptist’s head on a platter., I would say,—
Who went and danced and got men's heads cut off!
Have it all out!"" Now, is this sense, I ask?
A fine way to paint soul, by painting body
So ill, the eye can't stop there, must go further
And can't fare worse! Thus, yellow does for white
When what you put for yellow's simply black,
And any sort of meaning looks intense
When all beside itself means and looks nought.
Why can't a painter lift each foot in turn,
Left foot and right foot, go a double step,
Make his flesh liker and his soul more like,
Both in their order? Take the prettiest face,
The Prior's niece . . . patron-saint—is it so pretty
You can't discover if it means hope, fear,
Sorrow or joy? won't beauty go with these?
Suppose I've made her eyes all right and blue,
Can't I take breath and try to add life's flash,
And then add soul and heighten them three-fold?
Or say there's beauty with no soul at all—
(I never saw it—put the case the same—)
If you get simple beauty and nought else,
You get about the best thing God invents:
That's somewhat: and you'll find the soul you have missed,
Within yourself, when you return him thanks.
""Rub all out!"" Well, well, there's my life, in short,
And so the thing has gone on ever since.
I'm grown a man no doubt, I've broken bounds:
You should not take a fellow eight years old
And make him swear to never kiss the girls.
I'm my own master, paint now as I please—
Having a friend, you see, in the Corner-house!
Lord, it's fast holding by the rings in front—
Those great rings serve more purposes than just
To plant a flag in, or tie up a horse!
And yet the old schooling sticks, the old grave eyes
Are peeping o'er my shoulder as I work,
The heads shake still—""It's art's decline, my son!

He picks my practice up—he'll paint apace.

I know what's sure to follow. You be judge!

However, you're my man, you've seen the world

The shapes of things, their colours, lights and shades,
Changes, surprises,—and God made it all!
—For what? Do you feel thankful, ay or no,
For this fair town's face, yonder river's line,
The mountain round it and the sky above,
Much more the figures of man, woman, child,
These are the frame to? What's it all about?
To be passed over, despised? or dwelt upon,
Wondered at? oh, this last of course!—you say.
But why not do as well as say,—paint these
Just as they are, careless what comes of it?
God's works—paint any one, and count it crime
To let a truth slip. Don't object, ""His works
Are here already; nature is complete:
Suppose you reproduce her—(which you can't)
There's no advantage! you must beat her, then.""
For, don't you mark? we're made so that we love
First when we see them painted, things we have passed
Perhaps a hundred times nor cared to see;
And so they are better, painted—better to us,
Which is the same thing. Art was given for that;
God uses us to help each other so,
Lending our minds out. Have you noticed, now,
Your cullion'scullion term of contempt: a rascal hanging face? A bit of chalk,
And trust me but you should, though! How much more,
If I drew higher things with the same truth!
That were to take the Prior's pulpit-place,
Interpret God to all of you! Oh, oh,
It makes me mad to see what men shall do
And we in our graves! This world's no blot for us,
Nor blank; it means intensely, and means good:
To find its meaning is my meat and drink.
""Ay, but you don't so instigate to prayer!""
Strikes in the Prior: ""when your meaning's plain
It does not say to folk—remember matinsmatins a set time for morning prayers,
Or, mind you fast next Friday!"" Why, for this
What need of art at all? A skull and bones,

I saw where in the shroud did lurkA curious frame of Nature's work.A flow'ret crushed in the bud,A nameless piece of Babyhood,Was in a cradle-coffin lying;Extinct, with scarce the sense of dying;So soon to exchange the imprisoning wombFor darker closets of the tomb!She did but ope an eye, and putA clear beam forth, then strait up shutFor the long dark: ne'er more to seeThrough glasses of mortality.Riddle of destiny, who can showWhat thy short visit meant, or knowWhat thy errand here below?Shall we say, that Nature blindCheck'd her hand, and changed her mind,Just when she had exactly wroughtA finish'd pattern without fault?Could she flag, or could she tire,Or lack'd she the Promethean fire(With her nine moons' long workings sicken'd)That should thy little limbs have quicken'd?Limbs so firm, they seem'd to assureLife of health, and days mature:Woman's self in miniature!Limbs so fair, they might supply(Themselves now but cold imagery)The sculptor to make Beauty by.Or did the stern-eyed Fate descry,That babe, or mother, one must die;So in mercy left the stock,And cut the branch; to save the shockOf young years widow'd; and the pain,When Single State comes back againTo the lone man who, 'reft of wife,Thenceforward drags a maimed life?The economy of Heaven is dark;And wisest clerks have miss'd the mark,Why Human Buds, like this, should fall,More brief than fly ephemeral,That has his day; while shrivel'd cronesStiffen with age to stocks and stones;And crabbed use the conscience searsIn sinners of an hundred years.Mother's prattle, mother's kiss,Baby fond, thou ne'er wilt miss.Rites, which custom does impose,Silver bells and baby clothes;Coral redder than those lips,Which pale death did late eclipse;Music framed for infants' glee,Whistle never tuned for thee;Though thou want'st not, thou shalt have them,Loving hearts were they which gave them.Let not one be missing; nurse,See them laid upon the hearseOf infant slain by doom perverse.Why should kings and nobles havePictured trophies to their grave;And we, churls, to thee denyThy pretty toys with thee to lie,A more harmless vanity?

my head tilted up into the black walnut,

your nose pugged slightly, like Socrates,
your dark skin, your dark.
Your voice like a woodwind, a basset clarinet;
the wind you went out on, the wind you came in on,
your hair the color of a violin,
the unambiguous quality of many of your pronouncements,
i.e., the time you said I was tortured by life,
your eyes boring through me, right
for the wrong reasons, again.
The time in New Orleans you were so angry,
I was so drunk, lurching in the curio shops full of shells.
A shell grows around itself, folding over
the first pattern, calcified into a whorled shape, not dissimilar
to the whorl on the top of our two heads,
the pattern of gorgeous irreplaceable error,
and for a while the only assurance we belonged,
we belonged to the same species.
And the joy was piercing, this piercing joy
came up in me, a whirring train, night,
on the way home, somewhere before Memphis.
The singing in my ears. A hurricane,
a hurricane outside to my right was photographed from a satellite
even as a criminal was being printed,
his thumb whorl down, twisted clockwise,
and the trees out in the dark strained,
growing, forming knots, their flesh burled in the timedrift.
I've wondered: does the twisting hurt them,
and did all your turnings and hidings wound you
as they did me, and did you notice my imprint,
my concealment in that fold of air beside you,
when into your boxy feet and brown hands
nails, nails were driven,
when you got into that car and went west,
when you sat under that tree almost forever?

We don't see the ocean, not ever, but in July and August when the worst heat seems to rise from the hard clay   of this valley, you could be walking through a fig orchard when suddenly the wind cools and for a moment   you get a whiff of salt, and in that moment you can almost believe something is waiting beyond the Pacheco Pass, something massive, irrational, and so powerful even the mountains that rise east of here have no word for it. You probably think I'm nuts saying the mountains   have no word for ocean, but if you live here   you begin to believe they know everything.   They maintain that huge silence we think of as divine, a silence that grows in autumn when snow falls slowly between the pines and the wind dies to less than a whisper and you can barely catch your breath because you're thrilled and terrified. You have to remember this isn't your land.   It belongs to no one, like the sea you once lived beside and thought was yours. Remember the small boats   that bobbed out as the waves rode in, and the men   who carved a living from it only to find themselves   carved down to nothing. Now you say this is home,   so go ahead, worship the mountains as they dissolve in dust,   wait on the wind, catch a scent of salt, call it our life.

I will not bless this mark upon your body.
For you the hurricane is rising fast;
I feel the horns of Moses in my head
And Law wrenched again from the dead
Hand of deity, and I descend out of the blast to you
Mad with loneliness upon this bed.
But I reserve also the rage
That broke the Law upon you like a rain of stone
That other time I saw you so could yearn.
The Law is broken, baby. I will not ascend again.

Of the renewing green.    That is where it all has to start:

To be a bride of my own lamentation
I wear a dress not of time’s poisoned quills
but feathers of discontent — kingfishers
ghosting in cornstalks, my field of frozen flutes.
The edge of descent, digression’s highway
brings a particulate ash to my mouth,
starry metals of the meadow’s cold snap,
ravens in the sycamore scorched to black.
I follow their echo’s loop and chase.
I master the map of never, raft
its fragments, mouth the brightness of human’s
leftover snow, details of fever-clouds
where the convent dissolves in violence.
I wear the canyon like a blank eye,
lay before the never-returning light
my silhouette, fossil of the drowned town’s scroll.•
Here, where your ghost is always departing
the ebb and flow of terrestrial tides,
I follow your echo’s loop and chase,
vortex streets of a cylindrical sound
infinite in its arrangements of light.
The evening veil, a partial reveal — 
how I appear to myself looking past
this fact of being underway. Each day
I stow my earthen materials
in preparation for the never-end.
In the snapshot of my dead friend, hanging
in the room where loved ones refuse return:
a gradual reduction of color.
Running out of time, neck-deep in water,
we knew no one was coming to help us
in the same way one denies language
to come from a picture. I imagine
love a revelation, not of mind — 
the blue gauze of planetary motion — 
a tone-on-tone painting of a body
floating on the sea’s shifting horizons.
It is a question of legibility.
When I became tired of depicting
poetry, I became aware of
another kind of plane, the kind
good for dwellings and their narrative escape.
Here children sit up all night by the flames — 
the orphan boy from blood-stained pottery
who singed his head and burned out both his eyes.
That was your life, a prefix for fire.
Spider will weave a ladder to your heart,
it is said, even though you are sleeping,
intoxicated by abandonment,
a bitter wind reminiscent of a wave.•
In the last days of my marriage to god,
I wandered his spiraled library
to read in the dark blank imprints of trees.
Relentless navigation through the stacks
of shell-tempered mortuary offerings,
sandstone saws recovered from the caves.
I lingered on the stairs of the convent
to write these things, to recollect myself.
Around midnight the mountains returned.
The clouds dispersed into semicolons
and I with them, into a new language,
its boat temporary, invisible.
I knew I would be traveling like this
for centuries. This was my first attempt
at vanishing. I would return before
anyone noticed poems to be found
in the forest, not the mind.
There’s a canyon between this version of me
and the shadow in the corner that is mine.
I wear this canyon like a blank eye.

1 Out the barred window sandbags in a sagging wall surround the guard post where a soldier half-hidden by the flag holds his rifle on his knees and looks a little lost. It’s Sunday and quiet, the traffic noise off aways, the sea behind the post flat as the tarps pulled tight over the troop trucks. Somewhere down the hall soldiers are being boys, telling some joke in Arabic in which I’m pretty sure I hear the word “zubrak”: I walk between shelves loaded with canned rations, the cool expiring slowly in the high-ceilinged roomwhile a pinned-up PSYOPS leaflet declares,If you sleep in a cemetery, you’re bound to have nightmares. 2 No one sees the doll’s decapitated head small and neat in rubble. Never tired or sleepy, the head is its own country obstinately surviving, the pupil of   its one eye peering through the glass’s pure transparency. And a few feet away lie its slim, plastic, long-legged thighs almost like an obscenity the eye watches over —no one in the street, nothing but bolt-marksfrom tank-treads scarring the concrete to give any of   it drama — and what about the way the lips’ frozen smirk keeps daring me to touch the sexless V between the thighs staring up at me? 3 The barracks dissolve into a reef   of   rubble in the fog.On either side of the road, crater after craterflashes with glints of glass, plastic bags,a chair leg clinging to a dismembered chair. The TV station, the power stacks thrusting up through mist, the black-bearded postersand banners strung across the streets lead to an absolute nowhere:all that’s left in the emptied town after the army pulled out are PSYOPS leaflets fluttering up around the car that winds down the coast road deeper into mist, headlightsprobing like instruments in a woundthey illuminate the more they violate.

          ONE
From Sappho to myself, consider the fate of women.
How unwomanly to discuss it! Like a noose or an albatross necktie   
The clinical sobriquet hangs us: codpiece coveters.
Never mind these epithets; I myself have collected some honeys.   
Juvenal set us apart in denouncing our vices
Which had grown, in part, from having been set apart:
Women abused their spouses, cuckolded them, even plotted   
To poison them. Sensing, behind the violence of his manner—
“Think I'm crazy or drunk?”—his emotional stake in us,   
As we forgive Strindberg and Nietzsche, we forgive all those   
Who cannot forget us. We are hyenas. Yes, we admit it.
While men have politely debated free will, we have howled for it,   
Howl still, pacing the centuries, tragedy heroines.
Some who sat quietly in the corner with their embroidery
Were Defarges, stabbing the wool with the names of their ancient   
Oppressors, who ruled by the divine right of the male—
I’m impatient of interruptions! I’m aware there were millions   
Of mutes for every Saint Joan or sainted Jane Austen,
Who, vague-eyed and acquiescent, worshiped God as a man.   
I’m not concerned with those cabbageheads, not truly feminine   
But neutered by labor. I mean real women, like you and like me.
Freed in fact, not in custom, lifted from furrow and scullery,   
Not obliged, now, to be the pot for the annual chicken,   Have we begun to arrive in time? With our well-known   
Respect for life because it hurts so much to come out with it;   
Disdainful of “sovereignty,” “national honor;” and other abstractions;
We can say, like the ancient Chinese to successive waves of invaders,   
“Relax, and let us absorb you. You can learn temperance   
In a more temperate climate.” Give us just a few decades   
Of grace, to encourage the fine art of acquiescence   
And we might save the race. Meanwhile, observe our creative chaos,   
Flux, efflorescence—whatever you care to call it!
         TWO
I take as my theme “The Independent Woman,”
Independent but maimed: observe the exigent neckties   
Choking violet writers; the sad slacks of stipple-faced matrons;   
Indigo intellectuals, crop-haired and callus-toed,
Cute spectacles, chewed cuticles, aced out by full-time beauties   
In the race for a male. Retreating to drabness, bad manners,   
And sleeping with manuscripts. Forgive our transgressions   
Of old gallantries as we hitch in chairs, light our own cigarettes,   
Not expecting your care, having forfeited it by trying to get even.
But we need dependency, cosseting, and well-treatment.   
So do men sometimes. Why don’t they admit it?   
We will be cows for a while, because babies howl for us,   
Be kittens or bitches, who want to eat grass now and then   
For the sake of our health. But the role of pastoral heroine   
Is not permanent, Jack. We want to get back to the meeting.
Knitting booties and brows, tartars or termagants, ancient   
Fertility symbols, chained to our cycle, released
Only in part by devices of hygiene and personal daintiness,   
Strapped into our girdles, held down, yet uplifted by man’s   
Ingenious constructions, holding coiffures in a breeze,   
Hobbled and swathed in whimsy, tripping on feminine   
Shoes with fool heels, losing our lipsticks, you, me,
In ephemeral stockings, clutching our handbags and packages.
Our masks, always in peril of smearing or cracking,
In need of continuous check in the mirror or silverware,   
Keep us in thrall to ourselves, concerned with our surfaces.   
Look at man’s uniform drabness, his impersonal envelope!   
Over chicken wrists or meek shoulders, a formal, hard-fibered assurance.   
The drape of the male is designed to achieve self-forgetfulness.
So, Sister, forget yourself a few times and see where it gets you:   
Up the creek, alone with your talent, sans everything else.
You can wait for the menopause, and catch up on your reading.   
So primp, preen, prink, pluck, and prize your flesh,
All posturings! All ravishment! All sensibility!
Meanwhile, have you used your mind today?
What pomegranate raised you from the dead,
Springing, full-grown, from your own head, Athena?
         THREE         
I will speak about women of letters, for I’m in the racket.   
Our biggest successes to date? Old maids to a woman.
And our saddest conspicuous failures? The married spinsters   
On loan to the husbands they treated like surrogate fathers.   
Think of that crew of self-pitiers, not-very-distant,
Who carried the torch for themselves and got first-degree burns.   
Or the sad sonneteers, toast-and-teasdales we loved at thirteen;   
Middle-aged virgins seducing the puerile anthologists   
Through lust-of-the-mind; barbiturate-drenched Camilles   
With continuous periods, murmuring softly on sofas   
When poetry wasn’t a craft but a sickly effluvium,   
The air thick with incense, musk, and emotional blackmail.
I suppose they reacted from an earlier womanly modesty   
When too many girls were scabs to their stricken sisterhood,   
Impugning our sex to stay in good with the men,
Commencing their insecure bluster. How they must have swaggered   
When women themselves endorsed their own inferiority!   
Vestals, vassals, and vessels, rolled into several,
They took notes in rolling syllabics, in careful journals,   
Aiming to please a posterity that despises them.
But we’ll always have traitors who swear that a woman surrenders   
Her Supreme Function, by equating Art with aggression   
And failure with Femininity. Still, it’s just as unfair
To equate Art with Femininity, like a prettily packaged commodity   
When we are the custodians of the world’s best-kept secret:   
Merely the private lives of one-half of humanity.
But even with masculine dominance, we mares and mistresses   
Produced some sleek saboteuses, making their cracks
Which the porridge-brained males of the day were too thick to perceive,
Mistaking young hornets for perfectly harmless bumblebees.
Being thought innocuous rouses some women to frenzy;   
They try to be ugly by aping the ways of men
And succeed. Swearing, sucking cigars and scorching the bedspread,
Slopping straight shots, eyes blotted, vanity-blown
In the expectation of glory: she writes like a man!
This drives other women mad in a mist of chiffon.
(One poetess draped her gauze over red flannels, a practical feminist.)
But we’re emerging from all that, more or less,
Except for some ladylike laggards and Quarterly priestesses   
Who flog men for fun, and kick women to maim competition.   
Now, if we struggle abnormally, we may almost seem normal;
If we submerge our self-pity in disciplined industry;
If we stand up and be hated, and swear not to sleep with editors;
If we regard ourselves formally, respecting our true limitations   
Without making an unseemly show of trying to unfreeze our assets;   
Keeping our heads and our pride while remaining unmarried;   
And if wedded, kill guilt in its tracks when we stack up the dishes
And defect to the typewriter. And if mothers, believe in the luck of our children,
Whom we forbid to devour us, whom we shall not devour,
And the luck of our husbands and lovers, who keep free women.

across the sheen of the shining floor.

become the flight path

above red sand that it starts to float across

an AK-47 stood up on its butt end in a pile of rock.
The AK talks the talk of what guns talk—
not rage or death or clichés of killing,

No fear when it jams, no enemy running away,
no feeling like a river overflowing in a cloudburst—

The AK wants to tell a different truth—
a truth ungarbled that is so obvious
no one could possibly mistake its meaning.
If you look down the cyclops-eye of the barrel

rolled above his ankles.

at your elbow in the mess hall,
waiting to use, or just leaving, the showers and latrine,
the boy with his trousers rolled appears
like an afterimage burned into an antique computer screen,

There's a camel a goat a sandal left in red sand.
Over there's a water tower, under that's the bore hole
and here the body asks and asks about the role
it's asked to play: no matter how it's dressed.
Like a nomad like a journalist like the hyena
who eats even the bones
and shits bone-white scat from the calcium.
No matter if it sleeps under a dome
of UNHCR plastic, baby blue in the sun,
or hides in a spider hole
or walks around in uniform behind plate glass,
the body makes itself known before it becomes unknown.
On the television the blade runner is facing down the skinjob,
and of the two, who is the more human?
On the table there isn't a glass of whiskey but the ghost of whiskey
that keeps whispering, It's OK to be this way, nobody will know.
And then the boy who rolls his pantlegs
up above his ankles because to let them drag along the ground
is to be unclean turns right before your eyes into a skeleton.6/ THE COMING

the wound inside your head that you more or less shut out

Somebody who would never refuse money told me this—
about the syncretic effect when each person plugs
their attention into a field to read ad copy, let’s just say
they become opened up and other beings can see into
their minds. This was considered a science fiction idea
to many people, but not to me.
In my negative space construction is always occurring.
The liftoff from awful to tolerable
to positive and then finally to bright new beautiful
has been my most difficult task to swing.
But swing I will; there’s nothing else to do.
I live here and being here and hearing myself
or my mind’s divide through others convinces me
that I must do everything I can to save us from the pit.
That is, until the pit splits and the fruit tree finally grows.
You may have a tree of your own—you may have a home
in your own tree. Congratulations. If you write an instructive
pamphlet you can bet I will read it.
I do not want to go out in darkness.
I am doing everything I know to prevent this,
and thank you, by the way, if you’ve written a pamphlet.
The shared information system
and each being at the end of its screen
emits an LED (light emitting diode) on an often
green screen—you say I should give my
father up to the authorities. You blame your
circumstances on my choice—but it’s the authorities who
did this to him. How do you think a person loses his mind?
He let someone take it.
He is sort of my mind and you are too,
God help me.
The green screen is an ingenious discovery.
You can record events in a studio before the screen
and then key in whatever environment you like.
It’s a special color: Chroma Green,
but it can be blue too.
The experience of things is determined by our
feelings about them. Information is colored
by us. You may see remotely, in a photograph
for instance, the image of an ambush victim.
Maybe it is a war and/or she is caught naked.
If she is unhappy—indicated by face and body
arrangement—you may feel that.
Some people will hate the state of things that made her
so alone and vulnerable but few will do anything about it.
How do you find her? What guns surround her country?
And after all, maybe she would hate it.
To have to feel grateful to someone moved by her humiliation.
She may only be thinking about humiliation.
That is a tough feeling to shake.
Then, and I need not go too far into this,
then there are those who see the pain of someone
and they just love it. This may have something
to do with a revenge sentiment over their own unclosed wound.
The wound, they think, is everyone else’s fault
and they cannot forgive. This is only information,
in the form of speculation.
Some feelings you get when you consider
“What if this happened to me?” and you will want to remedy
the situation to secure yourself from the (negative) condition of it.
Together, humans create one body—the planet earth
and its projections. The things in the stomach
affect what goes on in the head. On the web
many people make money with miracle potions.
Some curb the human appetite.
Some say you can lose while consuming whatever you want.
I heard the other girl refer to me as a skull.
She was very angry and did not look or say hello.
There is a prevalent competitive notion
that each only has one place. That her face is only
hers and that I don’t have a face or to her it is death.
This she reads as me—the death of her.
Obviously I am not. I write and read and
then roll on. I wear an ordinary human face,
some could compare me to a bird of prey
because my nose is hooked and my fingers are long
and I like to ride my bicycle with the wind at my back.
I am not here to attack.
You are also a mutant.
Do you think you can keep the heavy metals outside of you?
Do you think you can go to sleep here
and wake up the same?
The screen is framed by plastic,
beneath that you use words to issue commandments
or call-outs.
Most people use the web to send messages
to people who are already their friends.
They make arrangements for later and
detail what happened in the past.
This information may be not true.
The web cannot know intention.
It records and is open to influence.
People make money through advertisements,
or so they think—well, selling ads, that’s quantifiable—
if ads make money, that is more difficult
to know unless there are special offers.
The web is full of special offers and 30-day
trials. If you fall for those, or I should say,
if you respond to the offer
what often happens is that your information
is shared with other companies who will fill your inbox
with offers (that which is known as spam).
Because you are someone who wants to look great
and there are other companies with products compatible
with your stated desire. Ways for you to achieve
the prevailing notion of beauty.
It is my job to tell you the models
are selected because they are physically improbable.
They are elevated to be made desirable.
Their desirability is physical because they are models.
If it were easy to be like that, they would not
be sought-after by manufacturers.
Generally, working people need to be sturdy.
Advertisers want to make money.
They go with psychology and so create a sort of
self-rejection by advocating forms not reflected in most people.
They know that people will pay in to be of an elevated form
no matter what station they are from.
Everyone wants to be beautiful.
Everyone wants to be the agreed-upon beautiful thing.
Probably everyone is beautiful somewhere inside
if not outside. You can create an excellent argument
for your being and improve upon ability. That is my opinion.
If you live alone, you may know how great the web can be.
On it there is information and pornography.
Information includes
the prospects.
Pornography is the biggest industry in America.
It is designed to bring about a certain state
of arousal, generally, couched in anger
that will allow the person to fuck exactly how they want to
without worrying about the one fucked.
Pornography is addictive for many.
Of course, sometimes people want to touch, to hear a voice
to imagine a partner and what they can do together.
The web has many dating services. My ex-psychiatrist
advised me against trying them.
She had transferred the daughter role onto me.
I do appreciate the dangers of strangers.
I am prepared with the information that pictures
are not people in both obvious and non-obvious ways.
I know at least three people who have been in love
with people they met online.
Each one is intelligent and down-to-earth.
I’ve gleaned from their descriptions of online courting
that the early questions are essential.
That and no expectation and somehow you have
to withhold your own personal information.
That is, until you meet up in a non-threatening place.
You will have to have someone know where you are,
a point person. And you will need a defense; mace, for instance
or a rape whistle or a dog leashed nearby
or in the car.
It will be important for him or her to know you have a dog.
They should meet each other as soon as possible.
This is the magic of the machine.
The meeting and love trial and,
if it works, the love made.
Well, that really is amazing.
Objectively amazing.
And good for the machine.
Good for the machine.
The electric web courses heavily through me.
This may be how we make history:
we can put up our movies, our words, or costume dramas.
We say we are so and so
and people follow the saga.
Do you ever get the problem which is opposite
to the problem of the watcher?
Have you ever only seen yourself through other people?
Or thought that’s what it was but it was really your
thought processes transferred through them?
I should look up the word rubric again.
That and lacuna and devi.
In the thrift store nobody looked at me.
But the woman said, “Devi (hee, hee) Devi.”
A celestial being: what we all are.
True she might have meant devil.
I am not a devil.
I love my friends most of the time.
I love animals—I don’t think devils do that.
My friend sends me pictures
of jackrabbits and frogs.
Yesterday, he said he saw buttercups, a type of flower.
You go over the tracks first, on the other side of the river
and there they are.

After a Nick Cave “Soundsuit” made from buttons and found vintage abacus



When George Washington became president in
1789 he had only one tooth in his head, a single
premolar poking up from his gums. His dent-
ures were fashioned from lead, gold wire springs,
brass screws, the teeth of humans and cows, ele-
phant ivory, and hippopotamus bone. It is a myth
that he had false teeth made of wood. A mis-
perception put forth by those misled by the hair-
line fractures that ivory and bone possess. Just as
cherry wine will stain cloth with a rust-hued vein,
Washington’s fondness for dark wine blemished
his teeth. The fractures eventually darkening, un-
til resembling the grain in a piece of wood.
The darkening of fractures is rather curious.
The makeup of the flesh, the constitution of
origin, the trackers of bloodlines thrown off
the trail. It is difficult to determine what discolor-
ations have tunneled their way through the body.
Spider veins climbing the back of my legs like a
winding river mapping the trauma. An unspoken
collective of ephemeral bits and bytes, suffering
most eloquently preserved in the mouth. The skin
of one’s teeth decides many a fate. A black woman’s
incisor settling down inside a white man’s maw.
Overall, a quizzical look, an off-color joke about
progress, the very blood a trick of the eye, an ocean
blue on the outside of the skin, a blushing
red if viewed just beneath the sheath.•
A tooth is made up of the crown and the root,
all the King’s Men destined to revolt. There are
many ways to worm your way inside, many open-
ings in the body of an animal. Some orifices gated
with white entryways. A wooden portcullis, a pick-
et fence, a laced corset secured tightly by a maid,
a pointed geode just waiting to be pulled, the cavern
wall glittering in the dark. Sharp crystals ornament
the cave’s jawbone. Cave canem, quite naturally speak-
ing. A hooded hole a place for some to hide or go
seek. A toothless whistle the signal for the slave
hunting bloodhounds, with canines fanged like
water moccasins. The swamp mud gushing like
the suppertime mush sloshing between the gums
of a Confederate soldier. The terror of limbs at
odds with the self. In World War I, trench foot
meant frequent amputations, the blade sliding
like floss between each toe. Some diseases attack
the foot or mouth, gums left inflamed in the
cross fire. A grieving mother wears dog tags
around her neck. Her son’s baby shoes and teeth
cast in bronze. The pulp at the center is how the
tooth receives nourishment, how it transmits
signals to the brain. The forgetting makes the
present tense possible. Memory is the gravity
of the mind. All the icebergs have started to
melt, milky objects left hanging by a
string, the doorknobs means to an end.•
The keyboard’s toothy smile splayed wide,
the flatlined cursor blinks impatiently on the
screen, my fingers struggle to tap into word
processing. I monitor all of the track changes.
Even the computer is a slave to death. Its in-
nards already bygone, its body obsolete upon
year of purchase. I am a librarian, swimming the
digital divide, my predecessor’s paddles — 
a mass of floppy disks in an office closet.
They pile up like the teeth of slaves waiting
for sale. An affluent businessman at the door,
his hands panning the saliva for white gold.
His fingers parting the cavity, pursed lips cooing,I need something of yours to call my own. The desire
to chew and smile at will. My grandmother lost
her mind before her teeth, lost the memories be-
fore the enamel gave way to rot. My face has my
mother’s abacus features. We are, in fact, diphyo-
dont. In one lifetime we develop two sets of teeth.
The missing space filled with air, a hollow exile
before the native tongue. I pray my unborn child
will have a gap. What the French call “dents du
bonheur” or lucky teeth. The womb’s peephole is
rather impressionable. I will fasten the buttons of
time. I will take the baby’s body in my own,
whisper a plea in its discriminating ear:Try to keep your wits about you, my love.

As late afternoons I have witnessed the distant
towers borrow luster from a bourbon sun, in-box
 
empty, surround sound on, all my money made
in lieu of conversation—where conversation indicates
the presence of desire in the parties to embark on
 
exchange of spirit, hours forzando with heartfelt phrase—
made metaphor for it, the face on the clock tower
bright as a meteor, as if a torch were held against
 
likelihood to illuminate the time so I could watch
the calm silent progress of its hands from the luxury
appointments of my office suite, the tumult below
 
or behind me out of mind, had not my whole attention
been riveted by the human figure stood upon

The clouds part revealing blueprints of the clouds
built in glass-front factories carved into cliff-faces
which, prior to the factories’ recent construction,
 
provided dorms for clans of hamadryas baboons,

of Thoth, god of wisdom, science, and measurement.
 
Fans conveying clouds through aluminum ducts
can be heard from up to a mile away, depending on
air temperature, humidity, the absence or presence
 
of any competing sound, its origin and its character.
It is no more impossible to grasp the baboon’s
full significance in Egyptian religious symbolism
 
than it is to determine why clouds we manufacture
provoke in an audience more positive, lasting
response than do comparable clouds occurring in nature.
 
Even those who consider natural clouds products
of conscious manufacture seem to prefer that a merely
human mind lie behind the products they admire.

cavorting over the backs of the people in the field
who cut the ripened barley, who gather it in sheaves,
 
who beat grain from the sheaves with wooden flails,
who shake it loose from the scaly husk around it,
who throw the now threshed grain up into the gently
 
palm-fanned air whose steady current carries off

believers in people, ideas and things, the workers
of the united fields of clouds, supporters of the wars
 
to keep clouds safe, the devotees of heartfelt phrase
and belief you can change with water over time.
It is the habit of a settled population to give ear to
 
whatever is desirable will come to pass, a caressing
confidence—but one unfortunately not borne out
by human experience, for most things people desire
 
have been desired ardently for thousands of years
and observe—they are no closer to realization today
than in Ramses’ time. Nor is there cause to believe
 
they will lose their coyness on some near tomorrow.
Attempts to speed them on have been undertaken
from the beginning; plans to force them overnight
 
are in copious, antagonistic operation today, and yet
they have thoroughly eluded us, and chances are
they will continue to elude us until the clouds part
 
in a flash of autonomous, ardent, local brainwork—
but when the clouds start to knit back together again,
we’ll dismiss the event as a glitch in transmission.

The clouds part revealing a congregation of bodies
united into one immaterial body, a fictive person
around whom the air is blurred with money, force
 
from which much harm will come, to whom my welfare
matters nothing. I sense without turning the light
from their wings, their eyes; they preen themselves
 
on the fire escape, the windowsill, their pink feet
vulnerable—a mistake to think of them that way.
If I turn around, the room might not be full of wings
 
capable of acting, in many respects, as a single being,
which is to say that I myself may be the source of
what I sense, but am no less powerless to change it.
 
Always around me, on my body, in my mouth, I fear them
and their love of money, everything I do without
thinking to help them make it. And if I am felt to be
 
beside the point, I have wanted that, to live apart
from what depends on killing me a little bit to keep
itself alive, and yet not happily, with all its needs
 
and comforts met, but fattened so far past that point
I am engrossed, and if I picture myself outside of it
it isn’t me anymore, but a parasite cast out, inviable.

steadily replaced by cold air from above, the cycle
 
repeating, the warm moving upward into massive
thunderclouds, the cold descending into the eye
around which bands of thunderclouds spiral, counter-
 
clockwise, often in the hundreds, the atmospheric
pressure dropping even further, making winds
accelerate, the clouds revolve, a confusion of energy,
 
an incomprehensible volume of rain—I remember
the trick of thinking through infinity, a crowd of eyes
against an asphalt wall, my vision of it scrolling
 
left as the crowd thinned out to a spatter and then
just black until I fall asleep and then just black again,

To those of a certain temperament, there is nothing worse than the

perhaps, connived at keeping it concealed.

that people were having sex and not telling him.

   —Ah but then Freud arranged it so that everyone had to tell.
    His psychoanalysis lights up the depths, makes our tangled web
transparent, to the point where I can see all the way down to It.
    And the process moves outward in increasing rings:
    The Master analyses his disciples. Who thereby—transparent
now—become masters and, in turn, take on others, patients or
disciples, to analyse.
    So that eventually there are no secrets.

When he had suckled there, he began

milk she could not keep from filling her,   
from pouring into his ravenous mouth,   
and filling again, miraculous pitcher, mercy   
feeding its own extinction . . . soon he was   
huge, towering above her, the landscape,   
his shadow stealing the color from the fields,   
even the flowers going gray. And they came   
like ants, one behind the next, to worship   
him—huge as he was, and hungry; it was   
his hunger they admired most of all.   
So they brought him slaughtered beasts:   
goats, oxen, bulls, and finally, their own   
kin whose hunger was a kind of shame   
to them, a shrinkage; even as his was   
beautiful to them, magnified, magnificent.

Puerto Rico was created when the pumpkin on top of
The turtle burst and its teeming waters poured out
With all mankind and beastkind riding on the waves
Until the water drained leaving a tropical paradise.
 
Puerto Rico was stumbled on by lost vampires bearing
Crucifix in one hand, arquebus in the other, sucking
The veins of land and men, tossing the pulp into the
Compost heap which they used as the foundation for
Their fortifications and other vainglorious temples.
 
Puerto Rico was arrested just as it broke out of the
Spanish jail and, renamed a trusty, it was put in an
American cell. When the prisoner hollered, ""Yankee, Go
Home,"" Puerto Rico was referred to the United Nations.

                    The Curator
                ","
We thought it would come, we thought the Germans would come,   
were almost certain they would. I was thirty-two,
the youngest assistant curator in the country.
I had some good ideas in those days.
Well, what we did was this. We had boxes   
precisely built to every size of canvas.
We put the boxes in the basement and waited.
When word came that the Germans were coming in,   
we got each painting put in the proper box
and out of Leningrad in less than a week.
They were stored somewhere in southern Russia.
But what we did, you see, besides the boxes   
waiting in the basement, which was fine,
a grand idea, you’ll agree, and it saved the art—
but what we did was leave the frames hanging,   
so after the war it would be a simple thing   
to put the paintings back where they belonged.
Nothing will seem surprised or sad again   
compared to those imperious, vacant frames.
Well, the staff stayed on to clean the rubble
after the daily bombardments. We didn’t dream—
You know it lasted nine hundred days.
Much of the roof was lost and snow would lie   
sometimes a foot deep on this very floor,
but the walls stood firm and hardly a frame fell.
Here is the story, now, that I want to tell you.   
Early one day, a dark December morning,
we came on three young soldiers waiting outside,   
pacing and swinging their arms against the cold.   
They told us this: in three homes far from here   
all dreamed of one day coming to Leningrad   
to see the Hermitage, as they supposed   
every Soviet citizen dreamed of doing.   
Now they had been sent to defend the city,   
a turn of fortune the three could hardly believe.
I had to tell them there was nothing to see
but hundreds and hundreds of frames where the paintings had hung.
“Please, sir,” one of them said, “let us see them.”
And so we did. It didn’t seem any stranger   
than all of us being here in the first place,   
inside such a building, strolling in snow.
We led them around most of the major rooms,   
what they could take the time for, wall by wall.   
Now and then we stopped and tried to tell them
part of what they would see if they saw the paintings.   
I told them how those colors would come together,   
described a brushstroke here, a dollop there,   
mentioned a model and why she seemed to pout   
and why this painter got the roses wrong.
The next day a dozen waited for us,
then thirty or more, gathered in twos and threes.   
Each of us took a group in a different direction:   
Castagno, Caravaggio, Brueghel, Cézanne, Matisse,   
Orozco, Manet, da Vinci, Goya, Vermeer,
Picasso, Uccello, your Whistler, Wood, and Gropper.   
We pointed to more details about the paintings,   
I venture to say, than if we had had them there,   
some unexpected use of line or light,
balance or movement, facing the cluster of faces   
the same way we’d done it every morning   
before the war, but then we didn’t pay
so much attention to what we talked about.
People could see for themselves. As a matter of fact   
we’d sometimes said our lines as if they were learned   
out of a book, with hardly a look at the paintings.
But now the guide and the listeners paid attention   
to everything—the simple differences
between the first and post-impressionists,
romantic and heroic, shade and shadow.
Maybe this was a way to forget the war
a little while. Maybe more than that.
Whatever it was, the people continued to come.   
It came to be called The Unseen Collection.
Here. Here is the story I want to tell you.
Slowly, blind people began to come.
A few at first then more of them every morning,   
some led and some alone, some swaying a little.
They leaned and listened hard, they screwed their faces,   
they seemed to shift their eyes, those that had them,   
to see better what was being said.
And a cock of the head. My God, they paid attention.
After the siege was lifted and the Germans left
and the roof was fixed and the paintings were in their places,   
the blind never came again. Not like before.
This seems strange, but what I think it was,
they couldn’t see the paintings anymore.
They could still have listened, but the lectures became   
a little matter-of-fact. What can I say?
Confluences come when they will and they go away.

When Heavy tells a story
the millwright shanty under the electric furnaces
chokes with quiet, amid the roar,
as Heavy pauses, adjusts his mountainous weight
over a creaky grease-stained metal chair
and looks up at the whirling ceiling fan
next to fluorescent lights hanging by wires.
His fingers lace like so many sausages
across the canvas of blue workshirt
on his chest.
 
Heavy tells his story
and the voice of reason quickens the demise
of foulness from red-faced millwrights
just back from a repair job
and sitting around for the five air whistles
that again call them to combat on the furnace floor.
 
All laughter stops, all nonsense sayings
and cuts of wisdom cease their echo
when Heavy tells a story.
 
Heavy talks about the Mexican melter
who once had an affair with the Pit Boss’s wife.
The heart of the problem–and the fact
from which the story’s plot revolves–
was that the melter lived across the street
from the Pit Boss.
One night just before the graveyard shift,
the melter left his home, kissed his wife’s
round face and proceeded to walk to the bus stop.
But a bullet pierced through his hardhat
and he fell, like an overturned stack of fire bricks,
onto the pavement.
The moral of this story:
Never have an affair with someone
whose old man lives
within shooting distance.
 
Heavy tells a story
about a furnace foreman who always yelled
at the laborers for failing to clean
the bag house of the built-up filth
from hours of cooking scrap iron and ore.
The men told him it was too dangerous
to walk on the tin-roofed panels;
their weight could cause
them to fall some 30 feet
into the gaping mouth of a flaming furnace below.
“Nonsense,” the foreman yelled,
“you’re all just lazy Polacks.”
(he called everyone Polacks).
The foreman then proceeded to walk
across the roof as the men stood nearby,
with mouths open, near the safety of side beams.
“You see,” he said standing in the middle
as hydraulics moved shutters
up and down to capture the sulphur dust.
 
Then the foreman moved forward
and before anyone could shout,
he crashed through the roof,
screaming into a reddened pot of molten metal;
the oxygen in his body making popping sounds
as it entered. The furnace operates continued
to pour ladles of scrap iron and to melt the steel.
They skimmed the slag off the top
and when it was ready, they poured
the molten mass into ingot molds.
There was nothing they could do for the foreman,
they said. Production had to keep going.
 
Heavy looks into the eyes of his listeners and says:
Somewhere there’s a skyscraper in downtown LA
with steel beams made from the ingot
with the foreman’s body in it.
Somewhere there’s a bridge or underground pipe
with the man’s remains chemically bound
within the molecular structure.
 
Heavy tells a story. . .
 
and the men lay down their tools,
and coffee is poured into heavy ceramic cups,
the shanty stills beneath the rumbling,
and even foremen stop by
to pay a listen
when Heavy tells a story.

And so you form a committee, convening with shotguns to fire every night into the darkling congregation. Every night, the air resounds with that resolve, and every dusk they return with theirs, circle, a lazy familiar vortex around a drain, an old appointment they keep with an inescapable place; this argument no way, Claude says, to be any less afraid.

Corinna, pride of Drury-Lane For whom no shepherd sighs in vain; Never did Covent Garden boast So bright a battered, strolling toast; No drunken rake to pick her up, No cellar where on tick to sup; Returning at the midnight hour; Four stories climbing to her bow’r; Then, seated on a three-legged chair, Takes off her artificial hair: Now, picking out a crystal eye, She wipes it clean, and lays it by. Her eye-brows from a mouse’s hide, Stuck on with art on either side, Pulls off with care, and first displays ’em, Then in a play-book smoothly lays ’em. Now dexterously her plumpers draws, That serve to fill her hollow jaws. Untwists a wire; and from her gums A set of teeth completely comes. Pulls out the rags contrived to prop Her flabby dugs and down they drop. Proceeding on, the lovely goddess Unlaces next her steel-ribbed bodice; Which by the operator’s skill, Press down the lumps, the hollows fill, Up goes her hand, and off she slips The bolsters that supply her hips. With gentlest touch, she next explores Her shankers, issues, running sores, Effects of many a sad disaster; And then to each applies a plaister. But must, before she goes to bed, Rub off the dawbs of white and red; And smooth the furrows in her front With greasy paper stuck upon’t. She takes a bolus ere she sleeps; And then between two blankets creeps. With pains of love tormented lies; Or if she chance to close her eyes, Of Bridewell and the Compter dreams, And feels the lash, and faintly screams; Or, by a faithless bully drawn, At some hedge-tavern lies in pawn; Or to Jamaica seems transported, Alone, and by no planter courted; Or, near Fleet-Ditch’s oozy brinks, Surrounded with a hundred stinks, Belated, seems on watch to lie, And snap some cully passing by; Or, struck with fear, her fancy runs On watchmen, constables and duns, From whom she meets with frequent rubs; But, never from religious clubs; Whose favor she is sure to find, Because she pays ’em all in kind.          Corinna wakes. A dreadful sight! Behold the ruins of the night! A wicked rat her plaster stole, Half eat, and dragged it to his hole. The crystal eye, alas, was missed; And puss had on her plumpers pissed. A pigeon picked her issue-peas; And Shock her tresses filled with fleas.          The nymph, tho’ in this mangled plight, Must ev’ry morn her limbs unite. But how shall I describe her arts To recollect the scattered parts? Or shew the anguish, toil, and pain, Of gath’ring up herself again? The bashful muse will never bear In such a scene to interfere. Corinna in the morning dizened, Who sees, will spew; who smells, be poison’d.

""NOW YAHWEH ORDERED THAT A GREAT FISH SHOULD SWALLOW HIM.""



Into my backyard’s six fat squares of concrete rigged with clothesline,   
Charlie the Cop swung gunnysacks convulsed with Jersey chickens.   
From the open view of other yards, unfolded down the block,   
neighbor women watched ours boil tub water; the barechested men,   
laying out knives and cleavers, fumbled the animals into daylight,   
in the middle of my world, my certain place, not stump roots   
on the cold Atlantic floor of mountains I’d imagined,   
one week every summer, from the hot Wildwood boardwalk.   
But just then Charlie lifted me above his head, saying   
“O Billy Boy you've never in your life seen this! Want it?”
The ground gone, steep drag of thinned air, chicken squawk
tingling in my ears with dim human voices. Charlie threw me in the sea.   
The underplace, swallowing my heart, opened like a horn of plenty,   
blood channels lit blue and red like pinball arteries, flesh-motes,   
mucus, sinew, pulsing viscera bits dripping from clothesline.   
Missile tracks horned across the ceiling. In the ribcage,   
stooped beggars crowded, kicking spongy gouts of something;   
deeper in the tunnel, toward the tail, in files winding out of sight,   
shaved heads, men and women in pajamas. Spear carriers paced the walls.   
Into my vaulted space came words not really words: shades, images   
with a worldly shape of meaning, but beyond me, aloof and hysterical.   
The silence wrapped me like a prickly woolen sleeve knit   
by my women’s voices, shouting, out there, unrecoverable, dense,   
while their horny hands plucked and the sweaty men teased,   
stuffing tacky down inside their headscarves. Inside,
blood cells combed my walls, unfinished patterns seeped through   
as picturegrams that glided across the whale’s belly. A still life   
with ginger jar and pomegranates. A flayed, ripening Christ.
An Ohio puddler stirring pigiron mash, whose back is the same one   
in Giotto’s Gethsemane that stays the hand slicing off a soldier’s ear.   
Mercury, my heart, the sickening beautiful shiftingness of things.   
Kettles steamed, tin basins quivered with guts, my dear hell’s bloodglyphs   
in things, in me. I’d not be whole in and of the world again.   
Quills cracked when Charlie put me down. In my backyard, in my head,   
women sang under a pier to the unformed sea, an unvoiced song   
I’d heard inside the monster, breezing now through clotheslines.   
Men scrubbed their hands at the spigot, the women sighing.   
Flies left charcoal scrawls on the air and grazed old stains;   
they lighted on my arms, not waiting, but constant, my familiars,   
until their manic newsiness went away. Then, in that twilight,   
slow, shadowless lightning bugs appeared, going on and off.

                ","
Drowned together in his car in Lake Chippewa.
It was a bright cold starry night on Lake Chippewa.
Lake Chippewa was a “living” lake then,
though soon afterward it would choke and die.
In the bright cold morning after we could spy
them only through a patch of ice brushed clear of snow.
Scarcely three feet below,
they were oblivious of us.
Together beneath the ice in each other’s arms.
Jean-Marie’s head rested on Troy’s shoulder.
Their hair had floated up and was frozen.
Their eyes were open in the perfect lucidity of death.
Calmly they sat upright. Not a breath!
It was 1967, there were no seat belts
to keep them apart. Beautiful
as mannequins in Slater Brothers’ window.
Faces flawless, not a blemish.
Yet—you could believe
they might be breath-
ing, for some trick
of scintillate light revealed
tiny bubbles in the ice,
and a motion like a smile
in Jean-Marie’s perfect face.
How far Troy’d driven the car onto Lake Chippewa
before the ice creaked, and cracked, and opened
like the parting of giant jaws—at least fifty feet!
This was a feat like his 7-foot-3.8-inch high jump.
In the briny snow you could see the car tracks
along the shore where in summer sand
we’d sprawl and soak up sun
in defiance of skin carcinomas to come. And you could see
how deftly he’d turned the wheel onto the ice
at just the right place.
And on the ice you could see
how he’d made the tires spin and grab
and Jean-Marie clutching his hand Oh oh oh!
The sinking would be silent, and slow.
Eastern edge of Lake Chippewa, shallower
than most of the lake but deep enough at twelve feet
to suck down Mr. Dupuy’s Chevy
so all that was visible from shore
was the gaping ice wound.
And then in the starry night
a drop to -5 degrees Fahrenheit
and ice freezing over the sunken car.
Who would have guessed it, of Lake Chippewa!
Now in the morning through the swept ice
there’s a shocking intimacy just below.
With our mittens we brush away powder snow.
With our boots we kick away ice chunks.
Lie flat and stare through the ice
Seeing Jean-Marie Schuter and Troy Dupuy
as we’d never seen them in life.
Our breaths steam in Sunday-morning light.
It will be something we must live with—
the couple do not care about our astonishment.
Perfect in love, and needing no one to applaud
as they’d been oblivious of our applause
at the Herkimer Junior High prom where they were
crowned Queen and King three years before.
(In Herkimer County, New York, you grew up fast.
The body matured, the brain lagged behind,
like the slowest runner on the track team
we’d applaud with affection mistaken for teen mockery.)
No one wanted to summon help just yet.
It was a dreamy silence above ice as below.
And the ice a shifting hue—silvery, ghost-gray, pale
blue—as the sky shifts overhead
like a frowning parent. What!
Lake Chippewa was where some of us went ice-fishing
with our grandfathers. Sometimes, we skated.
Summers there were speedboats, canoes. There’d been
drownings in Lake Chippewa we’d heard
but no one of ours.
Police, fire-truck, ambulance sirens would rend the air.
Strangers would shout at one another.
We’d be ordered back—off the ice of Lake Chippewa
that shone with beauty and onto the littered shore.
By harsh daylight made to see
Mr. Dupuy’s 1963 Chevy
hooked like a great doomed fish.
All that privacy yanked upward pitiless
and streaming icy rivulets!
We knew it was wrong to disturb the frozen lovers
and make of them mere bodies.
Sweet-lethal embrace of Lake Chippewa
But no embrace can survive thawing.
One of us, Gordy Garrison, would write a song,
“Too Young to Marry But Not Too Young to Die”
(echo of Bill Monroe’s “I Traced Her Little Footprints
in the Snow”), which he’d sing with his band the Raiders,
accompanying himself on the Little Martin guitar
he’d bought from his cousin Art Garrison
when Art enlisted in the U.S. Navy and for a while
it was all you’d hear at Herkimer High, where the Raiders
played for Friday-night dances in the gym, but then
we graduated and things changed and nothing more
came of Gordy’s song or of the Raiders.
“TOO YOUNG TO MARRY BUT NOT TOO YOUNG TO DIE”
was the headline in the Herkimer Packet.
We scissored out the front-page article, kept it for decades in a
bedroom drawer.
(No one ever moves in Herkimer except
those who move away, and never come back.)
The clipping is yellowed, deeply creased,
and beginning to tear. When some of us stare
at the photos our hearts cease beating—oh, just a beat!
It was something we’d learned to live with—
there’d been no boy desperate to die with any of us.
We’d have accepted, probably—yes.
Deep breath, shuttered eyes—yes, Troy.
Secret kept yellowed and creased in the drawer,
though if you ask, laughingly we’d deny it.
 
We see Gordy sometimes, and his wife, June. Our grand-
children are friends. Hum Gordy’s old song
to make Gordy blush a fierce apricot hue
but it seems cruel, we’re all on blood
thinners now.

Purged, with the life they left, of allThat makes life paltry and mean and small,In their new dedication chargedWith something heightened, enriched, enlarged,That lends a light to their lusty browsAnd a song to the rhythm of their trampling feet,These are the men that have taken vows,These are the hardy, the flower, the élite,—These are the men that are moved no moreBy the will to traffic and grasp and storeAnd ring with pleasure and wealth and loveThe circles that self is the centre of;But they are moved by the powers that forceThe sea for ever to ebb and rise,That hold Arcturus in his course,And marshal at noon in tropic skiesThe clouds that tower on some snow-capped chairAnd drift out over the peopled plain.They are big with the beauty of cosmic things.Mark how their columns surge! They seemTo follow the goddess with outspread wingsThat points toward Glory, the soldier's dream.With bayonets bare and flags unfurled,They scale the summits of the worldAnd fade on the farthest golden heightIn fair horizons full of light.Comrades in arms there—friend or foe—That trod the perilous, toilsome trailThrough a world of ruin and blood and woeIn the years of great decision—hail!Friend or foe, it shall matter nought;This only matters, in fine: we fought.For we were young and in love or strifeSought exultation and craved excess:To sound the wildest debauch in lifeWe staked our youth and its loveliness.Let idlers argue the right and wrongAnd weigh what merit our causes had.Putting our faith in being strong—Above the level of good and bad—For us, we battled and burned and killedBecause evolving Nature willed,And it was our pride and boast to beThe instruments of Destiny.There was a stately drama writBy the hand that peopled the earth and airAnd set the stars in the infiniteAnd made night gorgeous and morning fair,And all that had sense to reason knewThat bloody drama must be gone through.Some sat and watched how the action veered—Waited, profited, trembled, cheered—We saw not clearly nor understood,But yielding ourselves to the master hand,Each in his part as best he could,We played it through as the author planned.

Through the orange glow of taillights,   
I crossed the dirt road, entered
the half-mile of darkness and owl screech,   
tangled briar and fallen trunk, followed
the yellow beam of Billy Parker's flashlight   
down the slick needle-hill,
half crawling, half sliding and kicking   
for footholds, tearing up whole handfuls   
of scrub brush and leaf mold
until I jumped the mud bank, walked   
the ankle-deep creek,
the last patch of pine, the gully,

in front of Billy Parker's house,
spotted the black Chevy Camaro parked   
under a maple not fifty feet
from the window where Billy Parker rocked   
in and out of view,
studying in the bad light of a table lamp   
the fine print of his Allstate policy.   
I cut the flashlight, checked up   
and down the highway. Behind me   
the screech growing distant, fading   
into woods, but coming on
a network of tree frogs signaling
along the creek. Only that, and the quiet   
of my heels coming down on asphalt   
as I crossed the two-lane and stood
at the weedy edge of Billy Parker's yard,   
stood in the lamp glare of the living room   
where plans were being made to make me rich   
and thought of a boat and Johnson outboard,   
of all the lures on a K-Mart wall,   
of reels and graphite rods, coolers
of beer, weedy banks of dark fishy rivers,   
and of Billy Parker rocking in his chair,   
studying his coverage, his bank account,   
his layoff at Lockheed, his wife laboring   
in the maternity ward
of the Cobb General Hospital. For all   
of this, I crouched in the shadow
of fender and maple, popped the door   
on the Camaro, and found
in the faint house-light drifting
through the passenger's window
the stripped wires hanging below the dash.   
I took the driver's seat, kicked
the clutch, then eased again
as I remembered the glove box
and the pint of Seagram's Billy Parker   
had not broken the seal on. Like an alarm   
the tree frogs went off in the woods.   
I drank until they hushed
and I could hear through cricket chatter   
the rockers on Billy Parker's chair   
grinding ridges into his living room floor,   
worry working on him like hard time.   
Then a wind working in river grass,   
a red current slicing
around stumps and river snags, a boat-drift   
pulling against an anchor
as I swayed in the seat of the black Camaro,   
grappled for the wires
hanging in darkness between my knees,   
saw through the tinted windshield   
by a sudden white moon
rolling out of the clouds, a riverbank
two counties away, a place to jump and roll   
on the soft shoulder of the gravel road,   
a truck in a thicket a half-mile downstream.

Pity that brave heart awaiting its call    or the man enfolded by warmer love,    nothing's left today except my flimsy skeleton,    my eyes unhinged, confronting the era's beginning.    The era's beginning: are these ruined shacks,    these poor schools, these people still in rags and tatters,    this cloddish insecurity of my poor families,    is all this the day? the century's beginning, the golden door?    Well, enough said, I, at least, discreet,    as in office, patched and pensive,    I proclaim the redundancy of the inaugural:    I've arrived here with all my baggage,    bad luck and worse jobs,    misery always waiting with open arms,    the mobilization of people piled up on top of each other,    and the manifold geography of hunger.

—Barrio René Cisneros
Managua, Nicaragua, June-July 1982



This was the dictator’s land
before the revolution.
Now the dictator is exiled to necropolis,
his army brooding in camps on the border,
and the congregation of the landless
stipples the earth with a thousand shacks,
every weatherbeaten carpenter
planting a fistful of nails.
Here I dig latrines. I dig because last week
I saw a funeral in the streets of Managua,
the coffin swaddled in a red and black flag,
hoisted by a procession so silent
that even their feet seemed
to leave no sound on the gravel.
He was eighteen, with the border patrol,
when a sharpshooter from the dictator’s army
took aim at the back of his head.
I dig because yesterday
I saw four walls of photographs:
the faces of volunteers
in high school uniforms
who taught campesinos to read,
bringing an alphabet
sandwiched in notebooks
to places where the mist never rises
from the trees. All dead,
by malaria or the greedy river
or the dictator’s army
swarming the illiterate villages
like a sky full of corn-plundering birds.
I dig because today, in this barrio
without plumbing, I saw a woman
wearing a yellow dress
climb into a barrel of water
to wash herself and the dress
at the same time,
her cupped hands spilling.
I dig because today I stopped digging
to drink an orange soda. In a country
with no glass, the boy kept the treasured bottle
and poured the liquid into a plastic bag
full of ice, then poked a hole with a straw.
I dig because today my shovel
struck a clay bowl centuries old,
the art of ancient fingers
moist with this same earth,
perfect but for one crack in the lip.
I dig because I have hauled garbage
and pumped gas and cut paper
and sold encyclopedias door to door.
I dig, digging until the passport
in my back pocket saturates with dirt,
because here I work for nothing
and for everything.

The fools nearly killed me trying to make me one of them:
a loaded word of  bond with dress codes and penal codes,
postured allegiant to the culture as with the flying of flags
from knots tied on the back of  head wraps worn hoods over.
I can’t gunpoint when the life of this alter ego began though
the possibility can’t be dismissed it began at gunpoint in a way,

tracks while a circus of peers clowned.Going back far too long

even if  I stood as still as the air does before shit really hits the fan.
I truly went ass-first into fronting indifference, forbade my happy

round face, baby-angled, already read as kind or innocent or soft
from the jump when I wanted respect on my name and women on
my lap like it was said I should. And, shamefully, I did. Several
sistas come to mind here and this doesn’t make me feel good;
a tender touch in the moonlight goes only so far for a shadow.
I had to break it down for myself that being down represented
the fear of having fear.I still shake when the wind blows,
scary as ever, thespian as always in all ways toward the ghost
of a threat or disrespect passed through me then through me,
through a thin skin then through the skin. So, to compensate—
a mask, what Dunbar’s bars beat home way back when about
standing in the presence of the pale folks, only that idea flipped
upside down, what’d be a forced smile slicing the face open like
some summertime melon instead setting scowl folds into smooth
forehead, brown eyes set at the mouth’s corners, fixing it in the
position of silence like rusty nails.If carrying nothing else,
I learned to bring this exact look to the danger because being me
to the fullest would be a liability, provide a sharper image for the
hidden cameras to home in on; yes, just that fast—a certified blue,
strolling up to the screen door with a heavy hand for knocking and
his true hand resting so sweetly on his gun. My gun, I should say,
since in this case the cop is also me, like that little angel or devil
used as sitcom trope.Just imagine the person coming for you

A meadow brown; across the yonder edge A zigzag fence is ambling; here a wedge Of underbush has cleft its course in twain, Till where beyond it staggers up again; The long, grey rails stretch in a broken line Their ragged length of rough, split forest pine, And in their zigzag tottering have reeled In drunken efforts to enclose the field, Which carries on its breast, September born, A patch of rustling, yellow, Indian corn. Beyond its shrivelled tassels, perched upon The topmost rail, sits Joe, the settler’s son, A little semi-savage boy of nine. Now dozing in the warmth of Nature’s wine, His face the sun has tampered with, and wrought, By heated kisses, mischief, and has brought Some vagrant freckles, while from here and there A few wild locks of vagabond brown hair Escape the old straw hat the sun looks through, And blinks to meet his Irish eyes of blue. Barefooted, innocent of coat or vest, His grey checked shirt unbuttoned at his chest, Both hardy hands within their usual nest—   His breeches pockets — so, he waits to rest His little fingers, somewhat tired and worn, That all day long were husking Indian corn. His drowsy lids snap at some trivial sound, With lazy yawns he slips towards the ground, Then with an idle whistle lifts his load And shambles home along the country road That stretches on fringed out with stumps and weeds, And finally unto the backwoods leads, Where forests wait with giant trunk and bough The axe of pioneer, the settler’s plough.

you have relatives outside. And there are

Inside, I dreamed of constellations—

Thus freedom always came nibbling my thought,

you can pass an antelope and not know

there is something wrong about the grass.
And then you see.
That’s the way everything in the world is waiting.
Now—these few more words, and then I’m
gone: Tell everyone just to remember
their names, and remind others, later, when we
find each other. Tell the little ones
to cry and then go to sleep, curled up
where they can. And if any of us get lost,

Holland, that scarce deserves the name of land, As but th’ off-scouring of the British sand; And so much earth as was contributed By English pilots when they heav’d the lead; Or what by th’ ocean’s slow alluvion fell, Of shipwrack’d cockle and the mussel-shell; This indigested vomit of the sea Fell to the Dutch by just propriety. Glad then, as miners that have found the ore, They with mad labour fish’d the land to shore; And div’d as desperately for each piece Of earth, as if’t had been of ambergris; Collecting anxiously small loads of clay, Less than what building swallows bear away; Or than those pills which sordid beetles roll, Transfusing into them their dunghill soul. How did they rivet, with gigantic piles, Thorough the centre their new-catched miles; And to the stake a struggling country bound, Where barking waves still bait the forced ground; Building their watry Babel far more high To reach the sea, than those to scale the sky. Yet still his claim the injur’d ocean laid, And oft at leap-frog ore their steeples play’d: As if on purpose it on land had come To show them what’s their mare liberum. A daily deluge over them does boil; The earth and water play at level-coil; The fish oft-times the burgher dispossest, And sat not as a meat but as a guest; And oft the Tritons and the sea-nymphs saw Whole sholes of Dutch serv’d up for cabillau; Or as they over the new level rang’d For pickled herring, pickled heeren chang’d. Nature, it seem’d, asham’d of her mistake, Would throw their land away at duck and drake.

I’ll tell you two fortunes, my fine little lad,       For you to accept or refuse. The one of them good, and the other one bad;       Now hear them, and say which you choose! I see by my gift, within reach of your hand,       A fortune right fair to behold; A house and a hundred good acres of land,       With harvest fields yellow as gold. I see a great orchard, the boughs hanging down       With apples of russet and red; I see droves of cattle, some white and brown,       But all of them sleek and well-fed. I see doves and swallows about the barn doors,       See the fanning-mill whirling so fast, See men that are threshing the wheat on the floors;       And now the bright picture is past! And I see, rising dismally up in the place       Of the beautiful house and the land, A man with a fire-red nose on his face,       And a little brown jug in his hand! Oh! if you beheld him, my lad, you would wish       That he were less wretched to see; For his boot-toes, they gape like the mouth of a fish,       And his trousers are out at the knee! In walking he staggers, now this way, now that,       And his eyes they stand out like a bug’s, And he wears an old coat and a battered-in hat,       And I think that the fault is the jug’s! For our text says the drunkard shall come to be poor,       And drowsiness clothes men with rags; And he doesn’t look much like a man, I am sure,       Who has honest hard cash in his bags. Now which will you choose? to be thrifty and snug,       And to be right side up with your dish; Or to go with your eyes like the eyes of a bug,       And your shoes like the mouth of a fish!

""Come and hire me,"" I cried, while in the morning I was walking on the stone-paved road.Sword in hand, the King came in his chariot.He held my hand and said, ""I will hire you with my power.""But his power counted for nought, and he went away in his chariot.In the heat of the midday the houses stood with shut doors.I wandered along the crooked lane.An old man came out with his bag of gold.He pondered and said, ""I will hire you with my money.""He weighed his coins one by one, but I turned away.It was evening. The garden hedge was all aflower.The fair maid came out and said, ""I will hire you with a smile.""Her smile paled and melted into tears, and she went back alone into the dark.The sun glistened on the sand, and the sea waves broke waywardly.A child sat playing with shells.He raised his head and seemed to know me, and said, ""I hire you with nothing.""From thenceforward that bargain struck in child's play made me a free man.

                                                       The house near the sea
The houses I had they took away from me. The times
happened to be unpropitious: war, destruction, exile;
sometimes the hunter hits the migratory birds,
sometimes he doesn’t hit them. Hunting
was good in my time, many felt the pellet;
the rest circle aimlessly or go mad in the shelters.
Don’t talk to me about the nightingale or the lark
or the little wagtail
inscribing figures with his tail in the light;
I don’t know much about houses
I know they have their own nature, nothing else.
New at first, like babies
who play in gardens with the tassels of the sun,
they embroider coloured shutters and shining doors
over the day.
When the architect’s finished, they change,
they frown or smile or even grow resentful
with those who stayed behind, with those who went away
with others who’d come back if they could
or others who disappeared, now that the world’s become
an endless hotel.
I don’t know much about houses,
I remember their joy and their sorrow
sometimes, when I stop to think;
                                                       again
sometimes, near the sea, in naked rooms
with a single iron bed and nothing of my own,
watching the evening spider, I imagine
that someone is getting ready to come, that they dress him up
in white and black robes, with many-coloured jewels,
and around him venerable ladies,
grey hair and dark lace shawls, talk softly,
that he is getting ready to come and say goodbye to me;
or that a woman — eyelashes quivering, slim-waisted,
returning from southern ports,
Smyrna Rhodes Syracuse Alexandria,
from cities closed like hot shutters,
with perfume of golden fruit and herbs —
climbs the stairs without seeing
those who’ve fallen asleep under the stairs.
Houses, you know, grow resentful easily when you strip them bare.

                                                                Sensual Elpenor
I saw him yesterday standing by the door
below my window; it was about
seven o’clock; there was a woman with him.
He had the look of Elpenor just before he fell
and smashed himself, yet he wasn’t drunk.
He was speaking fast, and she
was gazing absently towards the gramophones;
now and then she cut him short to say a word
and then would glance impatiently
towards where they were frying fish: like a cat.
He muttered with a dead cigarette-butt between his lips:
— ‘Listen. There’s this too. In the moonlight
the statues sometimes bend like reeds
in the midst of ripe fruit — the statues;
and the flame becomes a cool oleander,
the flame that burns one, I mean.’
— ‘It's just the light. . . shadows of the night.’
— ‘Maybe the night that split open, a blue pomegranate,
a dark breast, and filled you with stars,
cleaving time.
                     And yet the statues
bend sometimes, dividing desire in two,
like a peach; and the flame
becomes a kiss on the limbs, then a sob,
then a cool leaf carried off by the wind;
they bend; they become light with a human weight.
You don’t forget it.’
                              — ‘The statues are in the museum.’
— ‘No, they pursue you, why can’t you see it?
I mean with their broken limbs,
with their shape from another time, a shape you don’t recognize
yet know.
                        It’s as though
in the last days of your youth you loved
a woman who was still beautiful, and you were always afraid,
as you held her naked at noon,
of the memory aroused by your embrace;
were afraid the kiss might betray you
to other beds now of the past
which nevertheless could haunt you
so easily, so easily, and bring to life
images in the mirror, bodies once alive:
their sensuality.
                              It’s as though
returning home from some foreign country you happen to open
an old trunk that’s been locked up a long time
and find the tatters of clothes you used to wear
on happy occasions, at festivals with many-coloured lights,
mirrored, now becoming dim,
and all that remains is the perfume of the absence
of a young form.
                               Really, those statues are not
the fragments. You yourself are the relic;
they haunt you with a strange virginity
at home, at the office, at receptions for the celebrated,
in the unconfessed terror of sleep;
they speak of things you wish didn’t exist
or would happen years after your death,
and that’s difficult because. . .’
                                       — ‘The statues are in the museum.
Good night.’
      — ‘. . . because the statues are no longer
fragments. We are. The statues bend lightly. . . Good night.’
At this point they separated. He took
the road leading uphill toward the North
and she moved on towards the light-flooded beach
where the waves are drowned in the noise from the radio:
                                                                   The radio
— ‘Sails puffed out by the wind
are all that stay in the mind.
Perfume of silence and pine
will soon be an anodyne
now that the sailor’s set sail,
flycatcher, catfish and wagtail.
O woman whose touch is dumb,
hear the wind’s requiem.
‘Drained is the golden keg
the sun’s become a rag
round a middle-aged woman’s neck
who coughs and coughs without break;
for the summer that’s gone she sighs,
for the gold on her shoulders, her thighs.
O woman, O sightless thing,
Hear the blind man sing.
‘Close the shutters: the day recedes;
make flutes from yesteryear’s reeds
and don’t open, knock how they may:
they shout but have nothing to say.
Take cyclamen, pine-needles, the lily,
anemones out of the sea;
O woman whose wits are lost,
listen, the water’s ghost. . .
— ‘Athens. The public has heard
the news with alarm; it is feared
a crisis is near. The prime
minister declared: “There is no more time. . .”
Take cyclamen. . . needles of pine. . .

                                                         The wreck ‘Thrush’
‘This wood that cooled my forehead
at times when noon burned my veins
will flower in other hands. Take it. I’m giving it to you;
look, it’s wood from a lemon tree. . .’
                                                                  I heard the voice
as I was gazing at the sea trying to make out
a ship they’d sunk there years ago;
it was called ‘Thrush’, a small wreck; the masts,
broken, swayed at odd angles deep underwater, like tentacles,
or the memory of dreams, marking the hull:
vague mouth of some huge dead sea-monster
extinguished in the water. Calm spread all around.
And gradually, in turn, other voices followed,
whispers thin and thirsty
emerging from the other side of the sun, the dark side;
you might say they were asking to drink a drop of blood;
familiar voices, but I couldn’t distinguish one from the other.
And then the voice of the old man reached me; I felt it
falling into the heart of day,
quietly, as though motionless:
‘And if you condemn me to drink poison, I thank you.
Your law will be my law; how can I go
wandering from one foreign country to another, a rolling stone.
I prefer death.
Whose path is for the better only God knows.’
Countries of the sun yet you cannot face the sun.
Countries of men yet you cannot face man.
                                                                     The light
As the years go by
the judges who condemn you grow in number;
as the years go by and you converse with fewer voices,
you see the sun with different eyes:
you know that those who stayed behind were deceiving you
the delirium of flesh, the lovely dance
that ends in nakedness.
It’s as though, turning at night into an empty highway,
you suddenly see the eyes of an animal shine,
eyes already gone; so you feel your own eyes:
you gaze at the sun, then you’re lost in darkness.
The Doric chiton
that swayed like the mountains when your fingers touched it
is a marble figure in the light, but its head is in darkness.
And those who abandoned the stadium to take up arms
struck the obstinate marathon runner
and he saw the track sail in blood,
the world empty like the moon,
the gardens of victory wither:
you see them in the sun, behind the sun.
And the boys who dived from the bowsprits
go like spindles twisting still,
naked bodies plunging into black light
with a coin between the teeth, swimming still,
while the sun with golden needles sews
sails and wet wood and colours of the sea;
even now they’re going down obliquely
toward the pebbles on the sea floor,
white oil-flasks.
Light, angelic and black,
laughter of waves on the sea’s highways
tear-stained laughter,
the old suppliant sees you
as he moves to cross the invisible fields —
light mirrored in his blood,
the blood that gave birth to Eteocles and Polynices.
Day, angelic and black;
the brackish taste of woman that poisons the prisoner
emerges from the wave a cool branch adorned with drops.
Sing little Antigone, sing, O sing. . .
I’m not speaking to you about things past, I’m speaking about love;
adorn your hair with the sun’s thorns,
dark girl;
the heart of the Scorpion has set,
the tyrant in man has fled,
and all the daughters of the sea, Nereids, Graeae,
hurry toward the shimmering of the rising goddess:
whoever has never loved will love,
in the light;
                      and you find yourself
in a large house with many windows open
running from room to room, not knowing from where to look out first,
because the pine trees will vanish, and the mirrored mountains, and the chirping of birds
the sea will empty, shattered glass, from north and south
your eyes will empty of the light of day
the way the cicadas all together suddenly fall silent.

I do not understand why men make war.
Is it because artillery is the most stoic example
of what flesh can become?
Is it because the military plan is the final map
drawn by the wisest hunter?
Is it because the neutron ray is the invincible finger
no one will disobey?
or
Is it because the flood of blood is the proper penance
workers must pay for failing tribute at the prescribed
hour?
I do not understand why men make war.
Is it because when death is multiple and expanding, there
among the odd assemblages, arbitrary and unnamed, there
among the shrivelled mountains, distorted and hollow, there
among the liquid farms and cities, cold and sallow, there
among the splintered bones of children, women, men and cattle
there and only there, the eerie head of power is being born?
Is it because submission is the only gesture to be rehearsed,
to be dressed, to be modeled, to be cast, to be chosen
in the one and only one drama to be staged in the theater of   
this world, where everyone must act with the backbone humbled
with the mascara of bondage, with the lipstick of slaves under
the light of gentle assassination with applause piercing the ground
forever?
or
Is it because war is the secret room of all things to be kept   
sealed and contained, to be conquered and renamed woman
enclosed by an empire of walls, vaults, hinges and locks with
the hot key that men and only men must possess for an eternal

                ","
Would you hear of an old-time sea-fight?
Would you learn who won by the light of the moon and stars?
List to the yarn, as my grandmother’s father the sailor told it to me.
Our foe was no skulk in his ship I tell you, (said he,)
His was the surly English pluck, and there is no tougher or truer, and never was, and never will be;
Along the lower’d eve he came horribly raking us.
We closed with him, the yards entangled, the cannon touch’d,
My captain lash’d fast with his own hands.
We had receiv’d some eighteen pound shots under the water,
On our lower-gun-deck two large pieces had burst at the first fire, killing all around and blowing up overhead.
Fighting at sun-down, fighting at dark,
Ten o’clock at night, the full moon well up, our leaks on the gain, and five feet of water reported,
The master-at-arms loosing the prisoners confined in the after-hold to give them a chance for themselves.
The transit to and from the magazine is now stopt by the sentinels,
They see so many strange faces they do not know whom to trust.
Our frigate takes fire,
The other asks if we demand quarter?
If our colors are struck and the fighting done?
Now I laugh content, for I hear the voice of my little captain,We have not struck, he composedly cries, we have just begun our part of the fighting.
Only three guns are in use,
One is directed by the captain himself against the enemy’s mainmast,
Two well serv’d with grape and canister silence his musketry and clear his decks.
The tops alone second the fire of this little battery, especially the main-top,
They hold out bravely during the whole of the action.
Not a moment’s cease,
The leaks gain fast on the pumps, the fire eats toward the powder-magazine.
One of the pumps has been shot away, it is generally thought we are sinking.
Serene stands the little captain,
He is not hurried, his voice is neither high nor low,
His eyes give more light to us than our battle-lanterns.
Toward twelve there in the beams of the moon they surrender to us.

                    Bat Cave
                ","
The cave looked much like any other
from a little distance but
as we approached, came almost
to its mouth, we saw its walls within
that slanted up into a dome
were beating like a wild black lung—
it was plastered and hung with
the pulsing bodies of bats, the organ
music of the body’s deep
interior, alive, the sacred cave
with its ten thousand gleaming eyes
near the clustered rocks
where the sea beat with the leather
wings of its own dark waves.
Below the bat-hung, throbbing walls,
an altar stood, glittering with guano,
a stucco sculpture like a Gaudi
church, berserk
Baroque, stone translated into
flux—murk and mud and the floral
extravagance of wet sand dripped
from a giant hand, giving back
blessing, excrement—return
for the first fruits offered to the gods.
We stayed outside, superior
with fear, like tourists
peering through a door, whose hanging
beads rattle in the air from
one who disappeared into the dim
interior; we thought of the caves
of Marabar, of a writer who entered
and never quite emerged—
the caves’ echoing black
emptiness a tunnel in the English
soul where he is wandering still. So
the bat cave on the Bali coast, not far
from Denpasar, holds us off, and beckons ...
Standing there now, at the mouth
of the cave—this time we enter, feel
inside the flutter of those
many hearts, the radiant heat of pumping
veins, the stretch of wing on bone
like a benediction, and the familiar
faces of this many-headed god,
benevolent as night is
to the weary—the way at dark
the cave releases them all,
how they must lift like the foam
on a wave breaking, how many
they are as they enter
the starlit air, and scatter
in wild wide arcs
in search of fruit, the sweet bites
of mosquito ...
while the great domes of our
own kind slide open, the eye
that watches, tracks the skies,
and the huge doors roll slowly back
on the hangars, the planes
push out their noses of steel,
their wings a bright alloy
of aluminum and death, they roar
down the runways, tear into
the night, their heavy bodies fueled
from sucking at the hidden
veins of earth; they leave a trail of fire
behind them as they scar
the air, filling the dreams
of children, sleeping—anywhere,
Chicago, Baghdad—with blood,
as the bombs drop, as the world
splits open, as the mothers
reach for their own
in the night of the falling
sky, madness in
method, nature gone
into reverse ...
here, nearly unperturbed,
the bats from the sacred cave
fill the night with their calls,
high-pitched, tuned to the solid world
as eyes to the spectrum of light, gnats
to the glow of a lamp—the bats
circle, the clouds wheel,
the earth turns
pulling the dome of stars
among the spinning trees, blurring
the sweet globes of fruit, shaped
exactly to desire—dizzy, we swing
back to the cave on our stiff dark
wings, the sweet juice of papaya
drying on our jaws, home
to the cave, to attach ourselves
back to the pulsing dome, until,
hanging there, sated and sleepy,
we can see what was once our world
upside down as it is
and wonder whose altars
those are, white,
encrusted with shit.

Sankt Georg, what was it, questionable, doubtful, shady, twilit,
a something area, something  Jan said, and he was born in Hamburg,
and went to school here, so he would know.
A little isthmus between the Alster with its freshwater sailors
and the railway station, always a reliable drag on things anywhere in Europe
(the transients, the drugs, the preset collisions between the foolish young
and the unscrupulous old), though this one piped classical music —  not anymore — 
to the forecourt, where taxi drivers got out
and walked their Mercs around in neutral
because they were hours without a fare and were saving diesel
(which was all very well in summer),
and the immediate, somehow always slightly grubby or compromised view
of three theatres, two museums, and le Carré’s bunker hotel,
but, hey, it was classy while it lasted,
and you could get to Milan or Moscow if you had to.
Then the Polizeibezirk of underage Puppenstrich about the time
B. came here from the country,
still often the only girl not on the game, among whores
and winos and people “with an immigration background”
looking grim and wearing subfusc and doing the messages, as we once said. Then gays — 
is there a pink euro, like a pink pound, and the Pink Pistols and gray wolves? — 
intrepid advance guard of gentrification.
So up the rents, send in the heavies, firebomb the buildings, locals out,
make improvements, and up the rents again, same everywhere.
A natty pellucid pissoir in the Hanser Platz that it would take Paris to pull off,
drunks round the monument (“reel around the fountain”), hardy trees and hardier women,
little roosters, little rosters in the apartment block for cleaning the common parts,
little brass squares set in the ground for individual fascist outrages,
with the victims’ names, the massy church at the end of the street — 
St. George’s, the AIDS church, the rainbow flag,
the incendiary community paper called the Dragon.
Sudden sad flurries of flowers, the curt pairs of dates,
a grown-out bleached person with one leg.
The main drag changed utterly,
meaning as usual stylistic diktat from elsewhere
and the birth of an interchangeably frippish hideousness. Three hat shops,
an empty tea bar (tax write-off? money laundry?) boasting sixteen varieties of macaroons,
endless places to stop (if you even wanted to stop) on the narrow pavement
between the heedless cars and the nosy passersby,
expensive ready-cooked food shops with names like Mom’s, gone
the hardware store that stocked everything and was staffed by people
who advised you where to find it for even less, out of business,
or moved away to less promising parts.
The photo shops, the record store, bookshop. All gone.
And behind that, the Steindamm, our belly and balls,
twinned with Kabul, or Mombasa, or Abuja.
Telephone shops if you wanted to call anywhere with a red, green, and black flag
(launch pad of Ali Ağca and his crew of martyrs), casinos,
thorny or hairy vegetables, fetish stores, Alphonso mangoes from Pakistan,
video brothels, limitless mint and parsley and cilantro, hourly hotels,
cracked olives and fresh cheese, old girls with three words of German, newly baked flatbread.
The birds strike up between three and four (it’s the Northern light),
while at lit intersections they never stop.
Twilit, doubtful, shady, something. Questionable.

poetry I am responding to a God who touched me in a perverse way. The

worship capital.   From   a   business perspective  my   poetics is   about
marketing a God who fondles with my white self. This is what makes my
poetry so friendly to the void in the world. I marketed a God who exploits
me to bring her message of panic to the poetry sector. I was watching a
Kenneth Anger film when a large aphrodisiac God converged on me and
told me to create a poem that pleases her. The results of her visit are

Jeremiah Dickson was a true-blue American,
For he was a little boy who understood America, for he felt that he must
Think about everything; because that’s all there is to think about,   
Knowing immediately the intimacy of truth and comedy,   
Knowing intuitively how a sense of humor was a necessity   
For one and for all who live in America. Thus, natively, and   
Naturally when on an April Sunday in an ice cream parlor Jeremiah   
Was requested to choose between a chocolate sundae and a banana split
He answered unhesitatingly, having no need to think of it
Being a true-blue American, determined to continue as he began:   
Rejecting the either-or of Kierkegaard, and many another European;   
Refusing to accept alternatives, refusing to believe the choice of between;
Rejecting selection; denying dilemma; electing absolute affirmation: knowing
         in his breast
                  The infinite and the gold
                  Of the endless frontier, the deathless West.

                ","
Three days later, Suljic was finally given a drink
of water and marched with a dozen other men
onto a small livery truck, one of two, fenced
along each side by wooden planks,
the back left open to give a clear shot
to the automatic weapon poking out the window
of the red sedan that followed, the squat nose
trained on them, ridiculously, as if they'd any thought
of hopping off a moving truck. Suljic peered
vacantly through the slats. He'd missed the yellow flowers
of Spring and by now saw a landscape taken over
by Summer, the grasses closing behind them as they veered
from the road and lurched across cow paths. They drove
to the center of a wide field and stopped. Old sweat,
without the breeze of movement, prickled in the heat.
A metal smell drifted, an untended apple grove
baked on a hill, and the weeds droned, motory with bees.
But Suljic noticed none of these, fixed instead
on the gaps in the field where bodies, all dead,
matted down the wild carrot and chicory, their khakis
splotched darkly, like a fawn's dappled haunches
obscuring them. The men clambered down into the tall grass
and lined up at gunpoint. Suljic was sure the last
good thing he'd ever see would be the apple branches
drooping with fruit, but the man beside him grabbed
his hand, and looked him in the face, as if
Suljic, just a bricklayer, had any assurances to give.
He squeezed the hand back, hard, and felt a scab
crossing the man's knuckles. He saw, too, a thin scar
worrying the arch of his left eyebrow, much older,
perhaps from a fall as a child from a ladder
picking fruit. His hand was like a clump of mortar,
and three nights without sleep had webbed his eyes red.
And Suljic suddenly stuttered to ask his name,
what town was he from, his job—anything—but there came
the crackle, like sometimes thunder, undecided
whether to begin, that starts, stalls, then trips
over itself, the sound crinkling from one
end of the sky to the other. The sound took possession
of his face until it, too, crinkled, his grip
pulsed, and he fell forward. Suljic winced
in the tackle of bodies, and splayed down in the dirt
flattening himself like a beetle, not hurt
in any new way, not yet convinced
he wasn't dead and didn't feel it. He heard the click
of fresh clips sliding into place, and shut
his eyes lightly, sure someone had seen he wasn't shot
and would come finish it. But no one came. Another truck
rolled up. The men climbed down, and lined up, docilely.
He recognized, solely by rhythm, a prayer, cut off
by the crackle, the hush of crickets, the soft
whump of bodies folding at the knees
and knocked by bullets shoulder first
into the grass. No one yelled. No one tried to run.
Another truck, another group, falling like a succession
of bricks sliding off a hod. Suljic finally pissed
where he lay, and blended in all the better
with the others. The noise stopped, and he cracked
his eyes enough to see, across the backs
like bleeding hills, a man strolling along the scatter
of bodies with a pistol, putting a slug
into the skull of anyone that still twitched
or mumbled. Then came the snort and low-pitched
rumble of diesel engines as two backhoes dug
a trench along the margin of all the collapsed
bodies. Impossibly, the crackling started anew,
and when darkness finally settled, the squads continued
in what light the backhoes' headlights threw. Perhaps
the shooting was over long before the sound
left him, the crackle to his eardrums
was like the rolling of a boat to his limbs
echoing long after he'd reached dry ground.
The soldiers left. Still he didn't move, but eased
his eyes full open. The moon above the orchard
was shrinking higher, its light glossing the awkward
pale forms that stubbled the dry weeds,
glinting off teeth and eyes. He scuttled from beneath
the arms and legs flopped sleepingly over
his own, as though by drunkards or lovers,
and rose like a foal to his numb feet,
seeing throughout the field no man not touched
by three dead others. He stood for a moment, trying
to guess, even roughly, their number, multiplying
bodies per square yard, but the math was too much,
the count too huge. He stared at the faces beside him
in the grass, like a man leaving something he knew
he would someday have to return to,
looking for the landmarks that would guide him—
the crooked teeth, the welted cheek, the pale eyes eclipsed
by half-shut lids, lolling upward, inward, swollen
as though with weeping, blood from an unseen hole
glistering down a chin line, crusting on lips.
How could he explain his life, what could he say
to those who weren't here to see, to the mothers and wives
who'd swear for years their men were still alive,
somewhere, the bodies never found, bulldozed into clay—
would he tell them how he tiptoed, unable to avoid
stepping on hands and ankles, or how the tears
like a secret he'd harbored through three years
of siege shook loose, and how he let them, no longer afraid
of being found out and cut down by gunfire,
or how he ran anyway, when he reached the open, quick
as his bum leg would let him, without a look
back at the faces turned like gourds in the dark mire.

Darkness: the rain sluiced down; the mire was deep;   
It was past twelve on a mid-winter night,
When peaceful folk in beds lay snug asleep;   
There, with much work to do before the light,   
We lugged our clay-sucked boots as best we might   
Along the trench; sometimes a bullet sang,   
And droning shells burst with a hollow bang;   
We were soaked, chilled and wretched, every one;   
Darkness; the distant wink of a huge gun.
I turned in the black ditch, loathing the storm;   
A rocket fizzed and burned with blanching flare,   
And lit the face of what had been a form   
Floundering in mirk. He stood before me there;   
I say that He was Christ; stiff in the glare,   
And leaning forward from His burdening task,   
Both arms supporting it; His eyes on mine   
Stared from the woeful head that seemed a mask   
Of mortal pain in Hell’s unholy shine.
No thorny crown, only a woollen cap
He wore—an English soldier, white and strong,   
Who loved his time like any simple chap,   
Good days of work and sport and homely song;   
Now he has learned that nights are very long,   
And dawn a watching of the windowed sky.   
But to the end, unjudging, he’ll endure   
Horror and pain, not uncontent to die   
That Lancaster on Lune may stand secure.
He faced me, reeling in his weariness,
Shouldering his load of planks, so hard to bear.   
I say that He was Christ, who wrought to bless   
All groping things with freedom bright as air,   
And with His mercy washed and made them fair.   
Then the flame sank, and all grew black as pitch,   
While we began to struggle along the ditch;   
And someone flung his burden in the muck,   
Mumbling: ‘O Christ Almighty, now I’m stuck!’

hungry children live in our bellies & run out with their

I’m working on my poems and working with   
my fingers not my head. Because my fingers
are the farthest stretching things from me.
Look at the tree. Like its longest branch
I touch the evening’s quiet breathing. Sounds   
of rain. The crackling heat from other trees.
The tree points everywhere. The branches can’t   
reach to their roots though. Growing longer they
grow weaker also. Can’t make use of water.
Rain falls. But I’m working with these farthest stretching
things from me. Along my fingertips bare shoots   
of days then years unfurl in the cold air.

                    The Orders
                ","
One spring night, at the end of my street
God was lying in wait.
 
A friend and I were sitting in his new sedan
like a couple of cops on surveillance,
shooting the breeze to pass the time,
chatting up the daydreams, the raw deals,
all the wouda-coulda-shoulda’s,
the latest “Can you believe that?”
As well as the little strokes of luck,
the so-called triumphs, small and unforeseen,
that kept us from cashing it all in.
 
And God, who’s famous for working
in mysterious ways and capable of anything,
took the form of a woman and a man,
each dressed in dark clothes and desperate enough
to walk up to the car and open the doors.
 
And God put a gun to the head of my friend—
right against the brain stem, where the orders go out
not only to the heart and the lungs
but to consciousness itself—a cold muzzle aimed
at where the oldest urges still have their day:
the one that says eat whatever’s at hand,
the one that wants only to fuck,
the one that will kill if it has to…
 
And God said not to look at him
or he’d blow us straight to kingdom come,
and God told us to keep our hands
to ourselves, as if she weren’t that kind of girl.
 
Suddenly time was nothing,
our lives were cheap, the light in the car
cold, light from a hospital,
light from a morgue. And the moments
that followed—if that’s what they were—
arrived with a nearly unbearable weight,
until we had acquired
a center of gravity
as great as the planet itself.
 
My friend could hardly speak—
he was too busy trying not to die—
which made me chatter all the more,
as if words, even the most ordinary ones,
had the power to return us to our lives.
 
And behind my ad-libbed incantation,
my counterspell to fear, the orders
still went out: keep beating, keep breathing,
you are not permitted to disappear,
 
even as one half of God kept bitching
to the other half that we didn’t have
hardly no money at all, and the other half barked,
“I’m telling you to shut your mouth!”
and went on rummaging through the back seat.
And no one at all looking out their window,
no one coming home or going out…
 
Until two tall neighbors came walking toward us
like unsuspecting saviors…  And God grabbed
the little we’d been given, the little we still had,
and hustled on to the next dark street.

Dusty and treeless, the street sloped beneath us.
Somewhere a hammer made thunderclaps,
forging the night-sky.
 
                                       Then the children,
seeing us, dashed from the Moorish houses,
vigorously shouting, vying for position,
while the bravest,
in worn underpants and plastic sandals,
climbed a high crater-like wall
and plunged, with murderous cries,
into the Roman pool
where blue-lipped fish waited.
Ah, those glorious soaked heads, spiked like palm fronds!
Seeing one in our group clutch her purse—
repelled by the wet black princes
who shivered in circles of yellow mud
and begged from us—
I felt ashamed.
In the brief African twilight,
a canary chirped something
shrewdly about avarice.
 
Far off, in the little neighborhood
where I grew—with neat cement walkways
and crab-apple blossoms—
money ran through the fingers
of our house, with nothing much
to record its loss but unhappiness:
one of us ironing servilely,
one of us sobbing in a bedroom,
one of us sleeping on a rifle,
one of us seizing another by the hair,
demanding the animal-like submission
we thought was love.
 
                                       Sunday evening.
Mother is wearing a big cotton shift
and tweezing her eyebrows.
Her head is a thicket of hairpins.
In the round hand-mirror
that parodies her face,
the world looks greater than it is.
I am next to bathe in the water
of the poor earth, reused by each of us
in order of birth. Gray with sodium and grit,
it covers me like a black robe,
and yet I feel exalted.

like wet Sahara sand, would fall,
scrubbing the hot labyrinthine
corridors of shuttered houses and aimless dogs,

purgative and inexhaustible,

When news came that your mother’d
smashed her hip, both feet caught
in rungs of the banquet table,

of the long lake of silence
when the stones of her body
broke as an Irish fence of stones,
I saw your wet dugs drag
with the weight of our daughter

to another feeding;
then the shoulders dropped
their broken antenna branches
of fear at the knife
running the scars
which had been born into the colon

the clubbed liver unclean
with the stones of the gall bladder,
and the broken arch of hip
lugging you to the lake,

swollen with innerpatching.
I pick you up from the floor
of your ringing fears, the floor
where the photographs you have worked
into the cool sky of the gray you love,
and you are back at the compost pile
where the vegetables burn,
or swim in the storm of your childhood,
when your father egged you on with his
open machinery, the exhaust choking your sisters,
and your sisters choked still.
Now this voice stops you in accusation,
and the years pile up on themselves
in the eggs of your stretched sons,
one born on his birthday, both dead.
I pull you off into the sanctuary
of conciliation, of quiet tactics,
the uttered question, the referral,
which will quiet the condition you have seen
in your mother’s shadow, the crutches
inching in the uncut grass,
and the worn body you will carry
as your own birthmark of his scream.

Stuck pat with strawberry magnets
to her sub-zero are all the stages:
gill slits, lungs, sex—stopped
at the third month, when the fetus
is sucked out into a clear plastic bag.
Reaching in for a quick soda, you can almost
feel that flexible wind on your face.
The fetus (named Jennifer, it says)
develops in color-photo sequence till the second
trimester, when (more bold-face) the kid's
a murder victim, in cold blood, of Mom. You beckon
to nothing: milk cartons, cans, stand in the chill blast
of the suction door and grab your Sprite.
Day and night she stands outside the clinics
with the other Lifers. My advice: don't
take her on. I once learned phylogeny
provides intelligent options—but survival
does not always select for insight.
Down the line: there's a smug printed
sign talking up adoption: Right.
So, knocked up, I'd owe my body to
an forgiving god, who'd swallow my offspring
t00? Here's a fat man rattling a blood red
genie in a pickle jar. No wedding ring.
See that woman, head bent—they're hurrying her
through the police cordon, past the screaming faces?
I've walked where she's walking now—
and where she lies now, I once lay,
behind that secured door, near that white
waiting table. My mind divided, momentarily,
as if the world were just birth or no birth,
what I could or could not do and still seem
human to myself. Who first fixed in
my head that slashed membrane between life
and death? (I'd go toe-to-toe against her,
but she stops me cold with her small, past due
figure of remorse.) God, what next?  she asks,
leaning against her icebox, her T-shirt
shouting how she pities the unborn. So do I.
But not as much as I pity her, quickening
with hate. And love: for those would-be
lives inbred to a set of family
gestures. One day on our way to the frog
pond we take my daughter's hands, saying
nothing—one on each side. She
asks me why I don't see what she believes.
I want to say I do, I see through all the cross-
wielding apologists to why she, alone in her kitchen, grieves.
It's sad. The big frogs croak like TV preachers
pad to pad. But look: at the pond rim
she points out tadpoles—hundredsm ink-black, legless.
See? we both say. My daughter kneels, tries to cup them
in her fist, but they're too fast. Born again and
again into the limits of our perception, they swim
intuitively, the way we think. She calls that
revelation. We're surrounded by the bull
chorus, a booming, backlit percussion. Call
it revelation ",Carol Muske-Dukes,"Living,Life Choices,Sorrow & Grieving,The Body",Living,The Body

“Who is this master of her ninety nipples?”
the public whispered.
Now the ocean is my audience,
I see in secret my last secret.2.
Mid-December, my old felt hat that I could have imagined
myself leaving behind in a restaurant for eternity
blew out into the Atlantic. The damn thing so familiar

Think of your child pedaling under your hand
and of a sudden—it just happens—you let go
and he's off on his own, free for that first time—
the achieve of, the mastery of the child.
See the stalwart trees in their silence
the stones resting in the driveway, the cat curled asleep
on the front porch, the smear of blood
on the lion's mouth sitting over his fresh gazelle
the morning paper and its stories shouting
for attention. The plenitude of it all.

Run from her smell, her teeth in the dish.)
Even dying, her life riots in her. We stand stock still
Though aswarm with itches under her disreputable smiles.
We manage to mean well. We endure, and more.
We learn time’s pleasure, catch our future and its cure.

One of the spectators is disappointed
there isn’t a guide to explain
the beaching, the scientists busy
cutting into ninety-four pilot whales
stranded on the salt grass.
No one knows why and, try as the rescue team
might, not one whale will go back to water.
So they’re injected to speed up the dying,
 
lined up like lumber and sawed into,
except when the black skin splits
we can’t stop staring, their meat is so red.
I don’t want to know why this happens—
what parasite or geomagnetic anomaly
finished their love of motion. Why should
anything have to leave this world
when water can cycle from atmosphere
down to land, the ocean and back
to forgiving sky.
 
                                      I’m on my way to Connecticut
where my father has a little vegetation
on his heart valve—that’s how the intern
describes it, trying to minimize
the danger of him slipping
into a haze so cold, some nights,
bone-cold, his hand can’t get from
his plate to his mouth.
 
                                                  Rain slicks the highway
slowing me down. The same water
fattened into snow in the woods
of my childhood, the whiteness
unbroken except where my father
cut trails and taught me to ski,
laying down the herringbone behind him
as he broke up hills that left me
with legs made of slush. He wanted me strong,
no patience for pain. No choice
but to find the muscle to follow. Even now
when he boasts how I zigzagged
the breakneck hills in an icestorm,
there’s no hint of my knee-chattering fear,
slats skittering out of control,
each run a victory of luck more than will,
each ride up the lift a prayer for my bones.
I wonder how it is for him now
there in the ward where whiteness can’t hide
the cold blank that’s ahead. When the whales
beached, spectators came like pilgrims,
each new arrival scanning the faces
of those heading back to their cars
to see how it changed them
to survey so much death. Nothing showed.
Their eyes followed the asphalt,
heads bent in private devotion.
 
                                                    There in a room
where others have died, my father
keeps a record of each test and drug.
He watches medicine drip into his arm
and circle in the dark of his blood.
I believe it will heal him, as I believe
in the strength of my blood
to protect me from failures of will. Once
when my grandmother at ninety-six
lay delirious with pneumonia,
pitching on her high horsehair bed,
she saw three crows perched on the dresser.
 
              They smell so awful, she said.Please, open the window. Let them out.
It was my father who did what she asked.
And the crows flew out, carrying her fever
over the treeline, dissolving into sky,
and she lived. Whatever she saw,
by love, luck or dumb Yankee will,
it was true. That’s what I mean by medicine.

Inside me lived a small donkey. I didn’t
believe in magic, but the donkey
was a sucker for the stuff. Psychics,
illusionists, arthritics who’d predict
the rainfall. That was the year I had trouble
walking. I over-thought it and couldn’t
get the rhythm right. The donkey re-taught me.
“This foot. Yes, then that one. And swing
your arms as if you’re going to trial
to be exonerated of a crime
you’ve most definitely committed.”
Next, trouble sleeping because
I’d need to crank the generator in my chest
so frequently. Seeing I was overworked,
the donkey finally hauled it out—
it looked shiny and new, a silver dollar—
and tossed it into a flock of birds
who had to fly a long way to find safety.
I knew then I was a large and dangerous man,
what with this donkey living inside me,
but felt futile. One day, during
a final lesson on breathing,
the donkey asked what kind of jeans
I was wearing. I said, “The somber ones.”
“Poor kid.” “So will you be staying on
for a third year, donkey?” “No. I think
I should be leaving soon. I think
I should go and await your arrival beside
the crumpled river.” “Yes, I suppose
you have many important matters to attend to,

Dinétah winter had frozen the ground
and the earth chipped like ice, slivers of crunchy cold beneath our feet.
Our bodies warmed by our work
and the earth chipped like an old tree being chopped, taking hours to finish.
Our bodies tired from our work
and the earth piled high beside the hole like the clouds and just as fluffy.

So today, yet another Guyanese will try to run the border
dressed in a dead housewife’s hair—all they’ve recovered
since her disappearance in a downtown shopping mall.
An “incident,” the paper says. Another “routine occurrence”—
wresting my trust from the publicans
assigned to keeping us safe, whole. Rather:
vow to stay vigilant against the maiming
that waits in each landscape, even in this
mundane procession of muddy spring days. To see
the tenacity of rooted hair for what it is:
an illusion as fleeting as courage. To keep the meat
between one’s ribs from being torn, to keep the hard
marble of the cranium covered with its own skin.
To stay vigilant. To watch the signs of violence stirring
even in one's own machine. To keep both breasts
attached and undiseased. To keep the womb empty;
and yet to keep the organs living there
from shriveling like uneaten fruit, from turning
black and dropping. And not to mistake the danger
for a simple matter of whether
to put the body on the streets, of walking
or of staying home—; there are household cleansers
that can scar a woman deeper than a blade
or dumdum bullets. The kitchen drawers are full of tools
that lie unchaperoned. Even with the doors and windows
bolted, in the safety of my bed, I am haunted by the sound
of him (her, it, them) stalking the hallway,
his long tongue already primed with Pavlovian drool.
Or him waiting in the urine-soaked garages of this city's
leading department stores, waiting to deliver up the kiss
of a gunshot, the blunted kiss of a simple length of pipe.
But of course I mean a larger fear: the kiss
of amputation, the therapeutic kiss of cobalt.
The kiss of a deformed child. Of briefcase efficiency
and the forty-hour workweek. Of the tract home:
the kiss of automatic garage-door openers that
despite the dropped eyelid of their descent do nothing
to bar a terror needing no window for entry:
it resides within. And where do we turn for protection
from our selves? My mother, for example, recommends marriage—
to a physician or some other wealthy healer. Of course
it’s him, leering from his station behind her shoulder,
who’s making her say such things: the witch doctor,
headhunter, the corporate shaman, his scalpel
drawn & ready, my scalp his ticket out.

To keep anxiety at bay, my friend called chemo dragonfly love. Those insects — christened, in places, the devil’s darning needles — hover as they contort their joined bodies into a heart, the male with pincers. Finger cutter, horse killer, ear stick, eye pisser. Look closely at the eyes of a female darner and you may well see dark puncture marks. As a slow drip through an IV. As a pill. Through a port into a vein. She called nausea erotica. Just the same, we name our storms to lessen them —  not a tropical cyclone, but Arabella, with ballet shoes and bun. Tumors, too, were friends, waiting at the bus stop with backpacks in the morning. Cindy French braids Carrie’s hair, yanking at the scalp to form the tight crisscross. Not hair loss, but deep conditioning. She gave us the new lexicon on stationery embossed with a red rose speckled by raindrops. The stem still had its thorns. Ring-around-the-rosy, red rover, red rover, send her right over. She called death the world of 10,000 things: the dragon courting its damsel, catheter tubing in the wastebin, video of a toddler biting his brother, pas de deux, full- sugar ice cream, Crimson Queen, Trumpeter, Red Knockout, Tuscany Superb  ...    I knew her as Rose Shapiro.

But inside her, there is always velvet,
velvet with its give and yield, the kind you
find at a pet store, a bin full of long
ears and noses busy snuffing up nerves
among the cedar chips and their eyes
opening wide as if rabbits couldn't know
what softness brings, as if they'd never know
the smell of something long stored away now
brought into light, and now too her mother
with a camera pointing at her, red
child on the lap of the Easter rabbit,
softness of the body hiding inside
the costume, eyes glinting from the wide holes
in the mask, not a single sobbing breath
of wind down the trail of mesquite and broom
foot-printing the hills of some rancher's land.
The bird dog lifts his ears to the sound
of velvet, the girl listens to the drawn
cries of a crow, her father walks
with the silence of the shotgun, waiting
for the pointer to find scent, the rabbit
at the end of it blinking, its wide eyes
shrinking from the scuffle of their feet like
velvet settling, laid over lines, drying
across the ceiling of an uncle's garage
where they talk inside the smell of salted
skin. At least three dollars for each good pelt
he says, and they scream like children when,
sleeves rolled over his forearms, he brings
the club down on their heads, saving
their feet for cheap key chains, for luck
that softness doesn't seem to have inside
of cages, chicken wire, tubes of water,
and sometimes boys who try kicking the cage
around to see what happens to velvet
tumbling. And, in the after quiet,
she bites the hands reaching toward her, so they
stone her, they open her belly and pull
some things out, open the pink albino
eye and groan at the fluid inside. Then they
bury the carcass without thinking first
of washing their sticky hands in the sink
before eating dinner, before setting
the table, in the still softness of her
beige room, she sits on the carpet picking
at the velveteen of Bunny's stuffed neck,
the rabbit's eyes dull with scratches, eyes left
behind on her bed at night when she stands
in the hall, hearing her father breathe in his room
in the darkness, on the futon, kicking
off the sheets. Awake from a fluid dream
of a woman's eyes staring from behind
a gag, her white skin settling in fat pools
around her, naked, bald. And a man's
voice said, this is your rabbit, so she woke
to this dream inside her, with his teeth wrapped
in her hair, and his hands inside her thighs
where he fingered her coldly. But it has
always been like this—wild, insidious,
and commanding because she gives to it,
fascinated by it and caught by it,
as velvet only listens and is quiet.

Inward lush unpetaling purpose in pink blooms of sleep, and I no longer needed to be separate. I was living there then, at the edge of the sea. And my friends came to visit, trying for a baby, not sure how to read me on that island of dozy sunlight. And there it was: familiarity edged with fear, the way we’d feed each other sandwiches and wonder if we should have wanted something other. We walked the folded cliffs over conifer fronds and mud runneling rocks slick with dropped fruit and rotting camellias to pause at the first ridge. We looked through high pines at the blue moving tides, then his finger caught a snag in the water and another and we saw — glinting fins wheeling the sheen, thousands playing in pods coming closer like the souls slippering into our bodies, attaching to matter as flippers angle into a ferrying strand. We too are a species, I realized. We too could know that as joy.

Endearments eager, and too brisk a bound, Throws off the Plow-share from the furrow’d ground.

The blood of language moves through the word cell from monk’s cell to prison cell to biological cell. I don’t know why a Braille cell is called a cell. I don’t know how many blood cells Louis Braille lost when the awl he was  playing with as a small child slipped and injured his eye.
Red blood cells live some hundred days before they are worn out by their silent hustle—looping and looping, pounded through the heart’s chambered cathedral, rushing out to the farthest reaches of the body with the good news of oxygen, squeezing single file along capillaries, like anxious deer probing their tracks through the woods. Rushing, silent, looping the circuits of the body. Again, again, again. Load iron. Dump iron. Load dump squeeze hustle.
Red blood cells pushed through the capillaries that pushed through my  retinas. They broke loose to run a green swarm in the corral of my eye. But that is history. Today cells still push through the capillaries fenced off by my calloused fingerprint. This one that I run over the Braille cell, the pattern of bumps.
—
A red blood cell is measured in microns. A solitary prison cell is measured in feet. Six feet by nine feet or less. I don’t know what the unit of measure is for how living in solitary changes a person. We know that living in a confined space, without access to the long view or landscape, changes the eye. The eye, for lack of practice, loses its ability to make out what lies in the distance. I don’t have a unit of measure for what this does to the heart.
—
A Braille cell is measured in spaces in a grid—two across by three down—that can be filled with a raised dot or bump. Different combinations of dots represent different letters, punctuation, symbols, shorthand.
—
The oldest cell I find in the dictionary is the monastic cell, a place for contemplation. From the concealed place where wine was stored. As in cellar. I find Braille contemplative. I touch my index finger to a bumpy piece of paper. My hand advances slowly left to right, the touch receptors in my finger triggered by the uneven contact of paper and skin. Messages run along nerves, finger-to-brain, brain-to-finger. Cognition sizzles. Mind notices this feels different than the pathway of sound in ear to auditory processing. Listening pulls me out into the world in an infinity of directions. Touching my reading educates me on my exact location in the world, feet in shoes, weight of foot on ground, weight of bones and flesh in chair.

Is everything a field of energy caused

Sometimes it seems like a world where no one

that contracts in response to electrical
charge? A swimming pool on the 18th floor?   King Lear done by sock puppets? Anyone
who has traveled here knows the discrepancies
between idea and fact. The idea is the worm

In between may be the sacred—real blood

landing sites in cornfields. Maybe ideas
are best sprung from actions like the children   
of Zeus. One gives us elastic and the omelette,

the poor couple a castle and a moat and two

That was before dentistry, which might have been   
a better gift. You did not want to get sick   
in the 14th, 15th, 16th, 17th or 18th centuries.
So too the 19th and 20th were to be avoided

He could not, no, he could not, no, althoughHe wheedled and cajoled, begged and promised,But they would not, no, they would notTake him to see The Curse of Frankenstein.Then his uncle called and offered and they caved.
 So next it was the matinee then home And nothing said, until he sat through dinner likeSome little diplomat, and after that excused himselfAnd took his plate and headed up to bed.Still nothing said. No, but midnight he woke up screaming.Morning, his father cleared the plates then turned, “That’s that,” he summarized, “too anatomical.”“What’s anatomical?” the boy asked back.
This was summer 1957. Monarchs foraged flowers, working colorsWith their yes-now-no-now light arrhythmias.By afternoon leaves shimmered in the heat,And in the evening intermittent waves Of fireflies telegraphed their kindWhile in the little deeps of darkened housesWindow units swallowed oceans of air,Until the boy, deep in his house, slept hard enoughThat when he woke he couldn’t close his hands.“But what was anatomical?” he asked again.
His father climbed a ladder to the attic where He bumped around then climbed back down Carrying an old foxed Gray’s AnatomyPacked full with illustrations, what seeing these The boy felt certain were the pictures of mixed meats.
That night the windows purred, and nothing budged, Till breakfast brought another book, this time One on pathology, which meant more pictures plus Diseases, where the worst were bestAnd came from “intimate contact.”
“But what was intimate?” he later pestered, Till his father downed his drink and said,“That’s how you made your way into this world.”Mother rose and left the room. The boy sat silent;He sat there calmer than the noggin of a cat,Until he stretched and, yawning, mentioned that He might just go on up and get to bed.
But secretly he understood; he knew For good-and-always that in fact His father wasn’t a serious manSo he was on his own and had to make Sense out of things himself, even if Some sense went wrong, like Frankenstein’s,Who wasn’t a serious man either —And that was really that, even if it meant You’d sink one day without so much as SOS.
Some nights that summer, sleepless, eyes pinned wide, He’d slip outdoors to watch his parents on the porch,Their cigarettes, their quiet talk, and then,For nothing he could tell, their laughter as His father fixed another round of drinks.And after that more laughter, like cicadas.
The boy watched this, as now he sometimes drives The five miles out-of-way to see that house again.And, never-you-mind his knowing better,Sometimes just his doing this sets off Imaginings that he is standing in the kitchenSaying, “Oh my dear animal family,How I loved you. How richly we purred.”
And sometimes too it sweeps back over him, His thinking that his father wasn’t a serious man.Those times, slowing the car, he says to himself,“Well then, you are not a serious man either.”

                    How to Draw a Perfect Circle
                ","
I can imitate the spheres of the model’s body, her head,Her mouth, the chin she rests at the bend of her elbowBut nothing tells me how to make the pupils spiralFrom her gaze. Everything the eye sees enters a circle,The world is connected to a circle: breath spools from the nostrilsAnd any love to be open becomes an O. The shape inside the circleIs a circle, the egg fallen outside the nest the serpent circlesRests in the serpent’s gaze the way my gaze rests on the model.In a blind contour drawing the eye tracks the subjectWithout observing what the hand is doing. Everything is connectedBy a line curling and canceling itself like the shape of a snakeSwallowing its own decadent tail or a mind that means to destroy itself,A man circling a railway underpass before attacking a policeman.To draw the model’s nipples I have to let myself be carried away.I love all the parts of the body. There are as many curvesAs there are jewels of matrimony, as many whirls as there are teethIn the mouth of the future: the mute pearls a bride wears to her  wedding,The sleeping ovaries like the heads of riders bunched in a tunnel.The doors of the subway car imitate an O opening and closing,In the blood the O spirals its helix of defects, genetic shadows,But there are no instructions for identifying loved ones who go crazy.When one morning a black man stabs a black transit cop in the faceAnd the cop, bleeding from his eye, kills the assailant, no one travelingTo the subway sees it quickly enough to make a camera phone  witness.The scene must be carried on the tongue, it must be carriedOn the news into the future where it will distract the eyes workingLines into paper. This is what blind contour drawing conjures in me.At the center of God looms an O, the devil believes justice is shapedLike a zero, a militant helmet or war drum, a fist or gun barrel,A barrel of ruined eggs or skulls. To lift anything from a fieldThe lifter bends like a broken O. The weight of the bodyLowered into a hole can make anyone say Oh: the onlookers,The mother, the brothers and sisters. Omen begins with an O.When I looked into my past I saw the boy I had not seen in yearsDo a standing backflip so daring the onlookers called him crazy.I did not see a moon as white as an onion but I saw a paper plateUpon which the boy held a plastic knife and sopping meat.An assailant is a man with history. His mother strugglesTo cut an onion preparing a meal to be served after the funeral.The onion is the best symbol of the O. Sliced, a volatile gas stingsThe slicer’s eyes like a punishment clouding them until they seeWhat someone trapped beneath a lid of water sees:A soft-edged world, a blur of blooms holding a coffin afloat.The onion is pungent, its scent infects the air with sadness,All the pallbearers smell it. The mourners watch each other,They watch the pastor’s ambivalence, they wait for the doors to open,They wait for the appearance of the wounded one-eyed victimAnd his advocates, strangers who do not consider the assailant’s funeralAppeasement. Before that day the officer had never fired his gunIn the line of duty. He was chatting with a cabdriverBeneath the tracks when my cousin circled him holding a knife.The wound caused no brain damage though his eyeball was severed.I am not sure how a man with no eye weeps. In the OdysseyPink water descends the Cyclops’s cratered face after OdysseusDrives a burning log into it. Anyone could do it. Anyone couldBegin the day with his eyes and end it blind or deceased,Anyone could lose his mind or his vision. When I go crazyI am afraid I will walk the streets naked, I am afraid I will shoutEvery fucked up thing that troubles or enchants me, I will try to murderOr make love to everybody before the police handcuff or murder me.Though the bullet exits a perfect hole it does not leave perfect holesIn the body. A wound is a cell and portal. Without it the blood runsWith no outlet. It is possible to draw handcuffs using loopsShaped like the symbol for infinity, from the Latin infinitasMeaning unboundedness. The way you get to anythingIs context. In a blind contour it is not possible to give your subjectA disconnected gaze. Separated from the hand the artist’s eyeBegins its own journey. It could have been the same for the Cyclops,A giant whose gouged eye socket was so large a whole onionCould fit into it. Separated from the body the eye beginsIts own journey. The world comes full circle: the hours, the harvests,When the part of the body that holds the soul is finally decomposedIt becomes a circle, a hole that holds everything: blemish, cell,Womb, parts of the body no one can see. I watched the modelPull a button loose on her jeans and step out of themAs one might out of a hole in a blue valley, a sea. I found myselfIn the dark, I found myself entering her body like a delicate shellOr soft pill, like this curved thumb of mine against her lips.You must look without looking to make the perfect circle.The line, the mind must be a blind continuous liquidUntil the drawing is complete.

                    Brad Pitt, Kevin Bacon, and the Brown Boy’﻿s Mother
                ","
When he wakes up out of sleep, the brown boy remembers two things: his white man calls and breaks the groans of Kevin Bacon, naked and writhing in pain on a hard and wet black street. Bacon has been beaten with broken bottles and has had his chest smashed in with a large flaming couch section. A mob of whites poured gasoline all over his chiseled stomach and then lit him afire. Brad Pitt lay next to him, his stomach breathless and glistening in the flame’s light.
     The brown boy knows this is somewhere between movie and dream, staring at each stomach; but more importantly, he knows that despite the fire, the bodies did not burn. They did not char or turn black. They simply shined in sweat.
     The brown boy will commit to his memory, most, Brad Pitt’s dying, and how he eventually turned over on his stomach, his penis turned down and scrape fucking the street—Brad Pitt ejaculating and on fire, the liquid shooting out of him as he looked up, staggered to his feet to let out something between groaning and laughter out to the black sky. Though Pitt had been beaten with bottles and wood, it was not clear where he was hurt, only that he was a screaming surface, dripping with lit gasoline and semen.
     As the brown boy ponders this surface, the white man has chosen to phone his brown boy. Their first conversation of the day is bound by this scene—and dutifully, for the white man, he wants to start from the beginning:
 Brad Pitt and Kevin Bacon are in a boxing ring in the middle of a football field. They are both wearing white boxer shorts, no gloves, and about to perform a dance routine. I am standing next to them, looking at Brad Pitt’s hair flop down over his face. He smiles at me before the music starts. From everywhere, broken glass bottles hurl at their bodies, and they are splashed with gasoline. We are also in a dark alley lit by fire. The two are still standing, looking over at me, though I can’t tell who is smiling. I only know Brad Pitt winks at me while Kevin Bacon is on the street, writhing as a large white flaming couch section is smashed onto his chest. My mother was dead in the dream. I was looking through a dense stash of clothes in a cabinet. All of them were soiled, and none of the clothes were hers. I remember holding a pair of purple and green Speedos that were woven to a pair of matching polyester tennis shorts. These shorts were my father’s. I remember my mother making all of his tennis shorts. I also remember pulling out a pair of long sweatpants that were much too large for my mother and holding them up as crumbs fell from the legs. I tried to smell them, wanting to think of her alive.
 
      What the brown boy doesn’t say is that he wondered, in the dream, how his father was getting through this—living alone with only her smell left behind. Or how he pulled the sweatpants up to his nose and mouth, absorbing the whole of her scent through his body. Without revealing his father’s grief or his own, the brown boy breathes in the smell of Giorgio mixed with eleven years of shifts at the convalescent home, and gives the white man what he thought he wanted. He quickly shot to the end, where Brad Pitt grinds his fat cock in the pavement, the curve of it pushing down bent and spewing semen into the street.
 Kevin Bacon stands up and groans, laughing as his bowels leak from his stomach. I was thinking about that before you called.
 
      The brown boy knows the white man wants to hear the brown boy rise from sleep, hear the spill from his head in the morning without saying a word. Though this morning, to this dream, the white man has two responses: He calls the dream bizarre and says nothing about the brown boy’s mother, only I feel sorry for Brad Pitt.

The Indiscriminate Citizenry of Earth are out to arrest my sense of being a misfit. “Open up!” they bellow, hands quiet before my door that’s only wind and juniper needles, anyway.  You can’t do it, I squeak from inside. You can’t make me feel at home here in this time of siege for me and mine, mi raza. Legalized suspicion of my legitimacy is now a permanent resident in my gut.  “Fruit of the prickly pear!” they swear, striding up to my table to juice me a glass of pink nectar. They’ve brought welcome baskets stuffed with proof I’m earthling.  From under a gingham cover, I tug a dark feather iridescing green — cohering to “magpie” thought, to memory’s chatter, to mind. Mine.  And here they have my mind translated into a slate-surfaced pond, which vibrates in the shape of a cottonwood’s autumn molt, which trees me to dirt, which soils me heat & freeze —  But you’ll always be one definitive document short! I complain. Doubts can forever outstrip your geo-logic.  For which they produce a lock of my natal dust, bronzed to the fluttering fiber of lacebark pine.  Where’d they get that stuff?  The baskets are bottomless, and it’s useless for me to insist on being distinct. Undergoing re-portation, I’m awakened to a Center,  where walls between all beings are dreamt to dissolve.

In a park, from the hides of  ten cows, he’d constructed a  giant ball that everyone touched until it became a torn rag.

My son recites the syllables I stumble over now, sets up figures as I did years ago in his prehistory. Here is the green ski slope of a brontosaur's back, there a triceratops in full gladiator gear. From the arm of a chair a pterodactyl surveys the dark primeval carpet. Each has disappeared from time to time, excavated finally from beneath a cabinet or the sofa cushions, only to be buried again among its kind in the deep toy chest, the closed lid snug as earth.

On the floor they face off as if debating the latest find, what part of which one of them has been discovered this time. Or else they stand abreast in one long row, side by scaly side, waiting to fall like dominoes, my son's tossed tennis ball a neon yellow asteroid, his shadow a dark cloud when he stands, his fervor for them cooling so slowly he can't feel it— the speed of glaciers, maybe, how one age slides into the next.

I looked around, as anyone would, for its mother.
Nothing was there. What did I know about lambs?
Should I pick it up? Carry it . . . where?
What would I do if it were dying? The hand

Where could they all have come from?
A second look, and the bleating lambs were birds—
kittiwakes nesting, clustered on a cliff face,
fixing on me their dark accusing eyes.
There was a kind of imperative not to touch them,
yet to be of them, whatever they were—
now lambs, now birds, now floating points of light—
fireflies signaling how many lost New England summers?

No more red tree

My heart a husky gore.

reaches through this sour air

2 COME ON IN, WE’VE BEEN EXPECTING YOU
like a clue
we found PEOPLE
in the KITCHEN
in the SUICIDE VEST
with the KALASHNIKOV
such beautiful, desperate weapons
their faces
had to be covered
so we didn’t fall in love
piteously
with the self-same wretchedness
we see in mirrors
a worryingly familiar scene
we’ve lived in will live in
the carnage
going on
behind closed doors
being told, regurgitatingly, “you only get one shot!”
but is it true
you only get one shot
when you get a loaded magazine
& plenty more
where that came from
in the MUNITIONS DEPOT
which I picture in Arizona, right
beside a render farm
and to the left
THE CLOUD
that backs up
and up and up
up
to where
are there edges, Bobby?
INTELLIGENCE tells us
to test the power of names
by naming things, for one thing
to name is to guarantee the end
like a starting pistol

I am so indifferent
to the limits
of feelings
I can’t tell the difference
every time someone lifts my flap
the unwashed salad
the unheated leftovers
the sanitary products are standard
but bear no relation
to what I expected
to feel overlaid
with various forms of filth
don’t you sometimes feel
like getting wrapped in a dog towel
and buried in the hardening ground
under the Canadian maple? Do dogs
need to approach death
and back away from it
like I did when the vet injected
deep pentobarbital & his bowels
ejected across the floor tiles
I was there
to inhale his fur and weep
for my benefit
I am not independent
of my feelings this way
of talking about feelings
has fooled each one of us
                             I’d rather be given CBT
                             by a border collie
when there are fewer words around
my arms around
his only
adored and stinking
neck 
dead
up my nostrils
throw me in there with him everything is in the cold awful and I’m not OK and without good reason still here and

6 JUST A GENTLE REMINDER
A LOT OF WORK
goes into making sex alluring sex
is just this and that
but it seemed, for a moment, that a new
climax had been won when
even the sky fingered me
with a slobbery insistence when
we were retching with so much desire
we created a whole new atmosphere
grabbing at sex things /
using the sick bag to be actually sick in
now the shower curtain is transparent
it’s a way of saying, “I want you too
to have this experience
so that we are more alike
like a sign that life struck once
in a slippy-bits marathon
that began when our eyes were magnets
yanked to each other’s fully-charged
crotches at a picnic
when it was essential
to make every enhancement
to our ‘connection’ by getting seriously indecent
beside the Bluetooth wireless speaker system
until even the trees had to dash inside
to pour ice in their underpants”
while I choked up playing the scene, as we lived it,
united by our pursuit of arrhythmia or
satisfying itches to that
catchy bridge section in Chopin
(I couldn’t wait to come
with Chopin through his melancholic meadow
(not that I approve of background music
(I prefer to foreground the piano
by massaging it loud and all over
until the top layer comes off in my hand
and the pedal squeaks for humanity
(I like to FEEL a piano as an instrument
of interruption and consciousness
(though I also like to take light swims, to get away
from what I FEEL (today I felt
jelly beans resemble kidneys))))))
which throbs like everyone grieving
 
 
 
 
 
7 HERE, HAVE A NEW PUPPY
said the Russians to the French
to soften the dog-loss
but mostly the dog’s image the image
is the greater likeness
except we never seem to run out of images
sometimes something in an image
runs through me and that is very common
as is reading about something
that’s happening to someone outside of me
until I know someone outside of me
without any knowledge
it is a test for my knowledge
to hang around until morning
practically all mornings are news to me
practically all knowledge is news to me
practically all news is images
going very fast around the world
so we have to guzzle them
like wrapped food
— hot and on the run —
in one end and squitted out the other
[pics or it didn’t happen]
until I’m fat with implications
and containing not a sausage

which were coated in whipped shea butter and
heavily comestible

he never knew
because we found all his needs
and perverted them
into a kind of inter-species loyalty
or the usual master-slave hierarchy
before laying down the crisp breakfast bowl
of the rest of his days
which gave us carte blanche to rush in anytime
and smother him with kisses
without getting socked in the eye
(unlike when I tried the same on Johnny (who spat my tongue out
      (& no one blamed him)))
when maybe all he wants is
just to go on
being less and less
subtle and alive

If rigor mortis sets in
it means there’s somebody who needs it.
It means that somebody
is drained and not awake
and deems any speckles of life unusable
and he is dead and dead
all dead in the humus
of trashed bodies shoved down there
dressed in made-up relationships.
What’s your favorite part?
Mine’s every part
with a maggot in it. Maggots
mean that life’s still leaking.
It’s like magic
when his dead voice
is nauseating
and I can’t see him
so he might as well be invisible.
It’s like magic when he isn’t
and doesn’t have anything to say
and I can’t bear to listen anyway
so I just recognize my fingers / all
the injuries they’ve inflicted
while my skin drops off.
What’s worse than a maggot
in the EAT ME
GLOVE-BOX DATES?
Does the 5-second rule apply
to something that drops dead?
Is it true he might come back
and crack open a piñata
blue alcopops, bombay mix, karaoke, and a pint of nostalgia
which is like thinking in another language,
I mean, how it feels, not what it means.
Half a maggot, the memory of
mange marching across his fur
describes a lot of other feelings
the feeling that someone else is taking up the whole room
the feeling that no one could help me now
or ever whether I was on several edges
my hot core and noggin facing this hammering world
of brainlessness and sweetbreads
was always a favorite word.
I don’t know what it tastes like but I know it’s terrible.

I’m so overcharged
that all I can do is literally slam
my hands / head / breasts against the keyboard.
Wherever there are
corpses there are maggots.
If we dig him up will he be wearing a jacket?
LOOK OUT
for the milkier, gentler solaces
which for all we know                   for all we know
could be the wind
or Chopin’s noise (still hammering the background) —
who’s seen it? Only its aftermath
is visible what’s not visible
is the aftermath of my screaming

Even city planning.
Yesterday, for example,
with its unexpected view of posterity
draped loosely between high-rises
 — unlike the composed street
raised to stoop level like a stroller. No moon
but clearly under some pressure to form one in quick stages,
while being careful to avoid what intervenes
with commas, speech tags, etc. Architraves pre-everything.
So that time, or what’s left of it,
prior to displaying its secret life (which wasn’t so secret to begin with)
waves everyone and everything away, including the burnished
sills and their plants lithographed with evening
plus the host of secondary qualities that rush in
on the least pretext, a new unit of space,
some jazz below, mouths to feed ... wrinkles alchemy
prints on studious foreheads. Or indeterminacy.
What did Rimbaud know about ageing anyway?
— More than you think.
Leaving (you might say) a colorful flag without a flagpole,
the parade route all but painted over like the history of unopposed takeovers
and the real wrinkle is that nothing is there for the taking
no matter how it appears. Shuffling off
to Buffalo or wherever they go to fill the intemperate, intermediate needs,
while the wisps of grass that inevitably push up between cracks look digital
and the buses squeeze their passengers to left and right
like shifts in basic economic priorities.
Have I mentioned noodling, as opposed to “raptures of attention”?
The effect without a cause — unless you’re one of those
who find that notion empty of meaning — 
not only in connection to instrumental music
(“I wasn’t playing anything I was just noodling”)
but phenomena in general, potential as well as kinetic,
from Y. Zowl singing “to a small guitar”
to our near-absorption in textures, weathers, (invasive) ellipses, sublimation, etc.?
To sum up: it’s not that the telegram to Elizabeth Bishop was  undelivered
but that the dead — if not busy licking their wounds — 
are absorbed with themselves, as we must appear to the perceptive hawks.
Dark gray, dark green, beet red all over, but also
(hence the notion of collateral damage when it applies) thickness tout court.

Yes, I was born on the street known as Glass—as Paper, Scissors or Rock.
   Several of my ancestors had no hands.   Several of my ancestors used their pens   in odd ways.   A child of seven I prayed for breath.   Each day I passed through the mirrored X       into droplets of rain congealed around dust.   I never regretted this situation.   Though patient as an alchemist I failed to learn English.   Twenty years later I burned all my furniture.   Likewise the beams of my house   to fuel the furnace.       Once I bought an old boat.   I abandoned the tyrannical book of my dreams   and wrote about dresses, jewels, furniture and menus   eight or ten times in a book of dreams.   It sets me to dreaming when I dust it off.   Our time is a between time; best to stay out of it.       Send an occasional visiting card to eternity or a few stanzas to the living   so they won’t suspect we know they don’t exist.   Sign them Sincerely Yours, Warmest Regards, Thinking of You or Deepest Regrets.   Brown river outside my window, an old boat riding the current.   What I like most is to stay in my apartment.   So that is my life, pared of anecdotes.       I go out occasionally to look at a dance.   Otherwise the usual joys, worries and inner mourning.   Occasionally in an old boat I navigate the river   when I find the time.   Water swallows the days.   I think maybe that’s all       I have to say   except that an irregular heart sometimes speaks to me.   It says, A candle is consuming a children’s alphabet.   It says, Attend to each detail of the future-past.   Last night the moon was divided precisely in half.   Today a terrifying wind.

Outside the room where you have lived a long time
Are other rooms, another building, just like yours.
Each night a ship sails past, wider than the building, taller than the highest church.
And though the passengers would like to visit the city,
No one in the city ever boards the ship. Would you?
Each night this spectacle is seen by you.
The street surveyed,
The air inhaled.
Grapes from the west,
Cinnamon from the east — 
If I’ve employed too liberally the passive voice,
Remember it’s the thoughts,
The feelings that are of consequence here,
Not the one who feels them.

Shall we walk to the market?
You could walk there blind, like Gloucester, smelling your way.
Shall we stop for coffee? Which café?
The one that’s commandeered by women, delicate cups?
Or the one where men preside, baristas in tuxedos, the coffee rich enough for rainy days?
A window, the desk, a lamp, and a chair — 
You’ve liked the room, you like to rearrange it for winter,
Put things back for spring.
But you’ve been young for a long time,
An embarrassingly long time.
Look what you wrote!
Remember how much, despite
Your ridiculous behavior, you’ve been loved.
 
3 
The city never changes, it’s never the same.
Sometimes the inhabitants restore a building, patch it up,
But in a generation they’re dissatisfied, they try again,
Expose the old parts so you see them
Plainly, ruined or not.
Who schooled you?
What made you scared of change?
Vividly you remember a child’s body; likewise you remember a man’s.
You woke up one morning,
There you were, a stinking adult.
What happened between? What will it be like,
You’ve seen the images, to watch your body spoiling
From the inside out, your lungs, your arms,
The muscles in your face — 
Look out the window,
Choose a single brick.
Once, a long time ago, the city was old.
 
4 
Clouds desire the sky, the sky the sun. The wave
Desires the land on which it trembles,
Repeating the same question, day after day — Am I allowed to ask for what I want?
And every day the land responds,Of course you’re allowed.You’re allowed to be angry, to rail,
You’re allowed to curse the God who put you here.
I’ve buried many people, old people, young people.
I’ve buried children while their parents wept beside the grave.
But I’ve also seen miracles.
Remember when they told you
You might die? You didn’t, you’re alive.
And every month since then, each minute, every second is a miracle.
What happens next you cannot know.

                ","
I spied everything. The North Dakota license,
the “Baby on Board” signs, dead raccoons, and deer carcasses.
The Garfields clinging to car windows—the musky traces of old coffee.
I was single-minded in the buzz saw tour I took through
the flatlands of the country to get home. I just wanted to get there.
Never mind the antecedent. I had lost stations miles ago
and was living on cassettes and caffeine. Ahead, brushstrokes
of smoke from annual fires. Only ahead to the last days of summer
and to the dying theme of youth. How pitch-perfect
the tire-on-shoulder sound was to mask the hiss of the tape deck ribbons.
Everything. Perfect. As Wyoming collapses over the car
like a wave. And then another mile marker. Another.
How can I say this more clearly? It was like opening a heavy book,
letting the pages feather themselves and finding a dried flower.

Everything stops.
A fat man on his way to Baltimore   
smokes for three hours in the club car.
The porter slips out and calls his wife,
he has one dime left and he’s almost   
yelling. Somewhere south of York,   
she thinks he said. The funeral   
procession leaves its lights on   
and out of this pure stubbornness   
its batteries go dead.
The bank robber leans on his horn   
in desperation while his partner   
snaps the rubber bands around   
the money. A band,
you can hear it up the river,
first like the new heart of the child on
your lap, then like an old moon   
pulsing below your nails, or something
softly moving through your arms and   
throat. Here,
press here, not just drums.
A clown is throwing caramels   
at the porch rails, balloons
are exploding or sailing up the river.   
The lucky trees, to be able   
to stand that close. If we talk   
too much, we’ll surely miss it.
And at the still center
of summer it starts; cowboys ride out out
of another life, old cars get up
from the dead and dance
like cripples hired out for a tent meeting.   
Up and down the sidewalk, the town   
sucks in its breath like a girl
taking short gasps just above her trumpet,   
or a fire engine’s horn, heaving
like a drowned man or a heat wave slapping   
against the water tower, this afternoon   
just like a parade. The sore-footed   
ponies are loaded down with flags   
and the library float says
“Immortal Shakespeare,” says it
with carnations and the hides of roses,   
says it with a jester and a princess   
wearing wings.
And she stutters, but no one cares   
or can hear her. Except for the man   
on the unicycle who tips his top hat   
to the crowd, who swears he will   
follow her anywhere, who follows   
the mayor and the city council, who   
follows the tap dancing class and the Future   
Farmers, the Lions Club and the Veterans   
of Foreign Wars; who clasps a carnation   
between his teeth and sways   
back and forth like
a broken clock.
And then things begin again,
a car follows the man on the unicycle   
and suddenly it’s just another car,   
a pair of dice dangling
from the rearview mirror, a woman   
giving her breast to a child and another   
child carefully peeling a crayon, then   
slowly giving the peels to his
grandmother, who opens the big brass   
clasps of her pocketbook and lets   
the bright curls drop slowly
to the bottom
like confetti or a boy’s first
haircut. Like a first yellow leaf
that fell when we weren’t looking.
Because it’s summer. Like a smooth   
yellow pebble that is rubbing and rubbing   
in the new left boot of the drummer,   
that someone skimmed on the river   
exactly at three o’clock.
Not out of anger or of boredom
this time, but as if it could almost   
wear wings.

the unsettling state of creation and how we have damaged—
isn’t one a suitable lens through which to see another:
               filter the body, filter the mind, filter the resilient land

              which tolerates the inconstant lover, the pitiful treatment

cataclysmic climate change

more like us than we’d allow, this wondrous swatch of rough
 
 
 
why do I need to say the toads and moor and clouds—﻿
in a spring of misunderstanding, I took the cricket’s sound
 
and delight I took in the sex of every season, the tumble on moss
the loud company of musicians, the shy young bookseller
anonymous voices that beckoned to ramble
             to be picked from the crepuscule at the forest’s edge
 
until the nocturnal animals crept forth
             their eyes like the lamps in store windows
                          forgotten, vaguely firing a desire for home
 
hence, the body’s burden, its resolute campaign:  trudge on
 
and if the war does not shake us from our quietude, nothing will
 
I carry the same baffled heart I have always carried
             a bit more battered than before, a bit less joy
for I see the difficult charge of living in this declining sphere
 
 
 
by the open air, I swore out my list of pleasures:
sprig of lilac, scent of pine
the sparrows bathing in the drainage ditch, their song
 
the lusty thoughts in spring as the yellow violets bloom
              and the cherry forms its first full buds
the tonic cords along the legs and arms of youth
              and youth passing into maturity, ripening its flesh
growing softer, less unattainable, ruddy and spotted plum
 
 
 
daily, I mistake—there was a medication I forgot to take
there was a man who gave himself, decently, to me & I refused him
 
in a protracted stillness, I saw that heron I didn’t wish to disturb
was clearly a white sack caught in the redbud’s limbs
 
I did not comprehend desire as a deadly force until—
              daylight, don’t leave me now, I haven’t done with you—
                            nor that, in this late hour, we still cannot make peace
 
 
 
if I, inconsequential being that I am, forsake all others
how many others correspondingly forsake this world

I sing you this song and I will sing another as well

I count the rays of the jellyfish:
twelve in this one, like a clock to tell time by,
thirteen in the next, time gone awry.
A great wind brought them in, left them here
to die, indifferent time measured by whirling moon
and sun, by tides in perpetual fall and rise.
Englobed, transparent, they litter the beach,
creatureless creatures deprived of speech
who spawn more like themselves before they die.
I peer into each and see a faceless
red center, red spokes like a star.
They are, and are not, like what we are.2
At noon, in the too bright light, watchful,
looking too hard, we saw the scene turn dark
and lost the children for a moment, waves
crashing around them. Shadow blended with shadow,
the sun inside a cloud, and then the children
were restored to us, our worst fears a hallucination.
All afternoon their castles, poor and proud,
rose and fell. Great civilizations were built,
came to an end, the children mighty lords, their castles
only as small as we are to the stars and starry structures.
The day was infinite for them, time stretching
to the farthest horizon, the sun their overlord.
But how to reconcile these summer days washing away
with our need to commemorate, to hold onto?
They knew. And so they sang a song tuneless and true,
admitting no fixed point, no absolute, words
overheard and blurred by great winds blowing in,
a rhyme or round for a time such as we live in:
The world is made, knocked down, and made again!3
This is the moment of stasis: gulls stall
above the burned-out mansion on the bluff,
gone for thirty years, and cairns rise up,
stone balanced on stone. By evening, the beach
is empty, my shadow a long-legged giant leading me
past small battlements to the day’s masterpiece:
a dripping castle, all towers and crenellation,
tall as a child, made by many children, flying
three-pointed flags that wave hopefully in the wind.
Closer, I see the moat, the courtyard’s secret
pool in which, macabrely, red jellyfish float,
death and potentiality entwined forever.
A crab small as my fingernail, dead,
perfect in every detail, with hairlike spinnerets
and claws, guards the open castle door from entry
as night begins to fall and shadows dark as ink
wash in to stain the beach. Shivering, I think,
O sentry, who would enter here?4
Traveling once, I stood under the open sky
inside a great unfinished cathedral.
Stonemasons, there for generations, clung
like ants to thin scaffolding, carving
griffins and saints, the rising spires and portals
dripping like hot wax, and birds flew
freely in and out of lacy walls, like angels
thrown down from heaven. Gaudy and grand,
it was a vision of eternal mind. Its maker,
dead for a long time, had left no finished plan,
design, but work went on, days turning
into years, the century coming to a close.
In disbelief, I touched each twisting vine
and leaf, marveling at what had been done,
and what was yet to be, and wished,
as I wish now, O let it never be complete!

It stood, and sun and moonshine rain'd their light On the pure columns of its glen-built hall. Backward and forward roll'd the waves of fight Round Troy—but while this stood, Troy could not fall. So, in its lovely moonlight, lives the soul. Mountains surround it, and sweet virgin air; Cold plashing, past it, crystal waters roll; We visit it by moments, ah, too rare! We shall renew the battle in the plain To-morrow;—red with blood will Xanthus be; Hector and Ajax will be there again, Helen will come upon the wall to see. Then we shall rust in shade, or shine in strife, And fluctuate 'twixt blind hopes and blind despairs, And fancy that we put forth all our life, And never know how with the soul it fares. Still doth the soul, from its lone fastness high, Upon our life a ruling effluence send. And when it fails, fight as we will, we die; And while it lasts, we cannot wholly end.

My life is the gardener of my body. The brain—a hothouse closed tight
with its flowers and plants, alien and odd
in their sensitivity, their terror of becoming extinct.
The face—a formal French garden of symmetrical contours
and circular paths of marble with statues and places to rest,
places to touch and smell, to look out from, to lose yourself
in a green maze, and Keep Off and Don’t Pick the Flowers.
The upper body above the navel—an English park
pretending to be free, no angles, no paving stones, naturelike,
humanlike, in our image, after our likeness,
its arms linking up with the big night all around.
And my lower body, beneath the navel—sometimes a nature preserve,
wild, frightening, amazing, an unpreserved preserve,
and sometimes a Japanese garden, concentrated, full of
forethought. And the penis and testes are smooth
polished stones with dark vegetation between them,
precise paths fraught with meaning
and calm reflection. And the teachings of my father
and the commandments of my mother
are birds of chirp and song. And the woman I love
is seasons and changing weather, and the children at play
are my children. And the life my life.
     2
I’ve never been in those places where I’ve never been
and never will be, I have no share in the infinity of light-years and dark-years,
but the darkness is mine, and the light, and my time
is my own. The sand on the seashore—those infinite grains
are the same sand where I made love in Achziv and Caesarea.
The years of my life I have broken into hours, and the hours into minutes
and seconds and fractions of seconds. These, only these,
are the stars above me
that cannot be numbered.

And what is my life span? I’m like a man gone out of Egypt:
the Red Sea parts, I cross on dry land,
two walls of water, on my right hand and on my left.
Pharaoh’s army and his horsemen behind me. Before me the desert,
perhaps the Promised Land, too. That is my life span.

in the universe without us. For as long as we live, everything is closed
within us. And when we die, everything is open again.
Open closed open. That’s all we are.
    5
What then is my life span? Like shooting a self-portrait.
I set up the camera a few feet away on something stable
(the one thing that’s stable in this world),
I decide on a good place to stand, near a tree,
run back to the camera, press the timer,
run back again to that place near the tree,
and I hear the ticking of time, the whirring
like a distant prayer, the click of the shutter like an execution.
That is my life span. God develops the picture
in His big darkroom. And here is the picture:
white hair on my head, eyes tired and heavy,
eyebrows black, like the charred lintels
above the windows in a house that burned down.
My life span is over.

I wasn’t one of the six million who died in the Shoah,
I wasn’t even among the survivors.
And I wasn’t one of the six hundred thousand who went out of Egypt.
I came to the Promised Land by sea.
No, I was not in that number, though I still have the fire and the smoke
within me, pillars of fire and pillars of smoke that guide me
by night and by day. I still have inside me the mad search
for emergency exits, for soft places, for the nakedness
of the land, for the escape into weakness and hope,
I still have within me the lust to search for living water
with quiet talk to the rock or with frenzied blows.
Afterwards, silence: no questions, no answers.
Jewish history and world history
grind me between them like two grindstones, sometimes
to a powder. And the solar year and the lunar year
get ahead of each other or fall behind,
leaping, they set my life in perpetual motion.
Sometimes I fall into the gap between them to hide,
or to sink all the way down.

what is the quickest way to get there, when to stop
and ask again. There, over there. The second
turnoff, not the first, and from there left or right,
near the white house, by the oak tree.

With limbs shaped like questions

Melting the bones with pity,

                ","
""Courage!"" he said, and pointed toward the land, ""This mounting wave will roll us shoreward soon."" In the afternoon they came unto a land In which it seemed always afternoon. All round the coast the languid air did swoon, Breathing like one that hath a weary dream. Full-faced above the valley stood the moon; And like a downward smoke, the slender stream Along the cliff to fall and pause and fall did seem. A land of streams! some, like a downward smoke, Slow-dropping veils of thinnest lawn, did go; And some thro' wavering lights and shadows broke, Rolling a slumbrous sheet of foam below. They saw the gleaming river seaward flow From the inner land: far off, three mountain-tops, Three silent pinnacles of aged snow, Stood sunset-flush'd: and, dew'd with showery drops, Up-clomb the shadowy pine above the woven copse. The charmed sunset linger'd low adown In the red West: thro' mountain clefts the dale Was seen far inland, and the yellow down Border'd with palm, and many a winding vale And meadow, set with slender galingale; A land where all things always seem'd the same! And round about the keel with faces pale, Dark faces pale against that rosy flame, The mild-eyed melancholy Lotos-eaters came. Branches they bore of that enchanted stem, Laden with flower and fruit, whereof they gave To each, but whoso did receive of them, And taste, to him the gushing of the wave Far far away did seem to mourn and rave On alien shores; and if his fellow spake, His voice was thin, as voices from the grave; And deep-asleep he seem'd, yet all awake, And music in his ears his beating heart did make. They sat them down upon the yellow sand, Between the sun and moon upon the shore; And sweet it was to dream of Fatherland, Of child, and wife, and slave; but evermore Most weary seem'd the sea, weary the oar, Weary the wandering fields of barren foam. Then some one said, ""We will return no more""; And all at once they sang, ""Our island home Is far beyond the wave; we will no longer roam."" CHORIC SONG I There is sweet music here that softer falls Than petals from blown roses on the grass, Or night-dews on still waters between walls Of shadowy granite, in a gleaming pass; Music that gentlier on the spirit lies, Than tir'd eyelids upon tir'd eyes; Music that brings sweet sleep down from the blissful skies. Here are cool mosses deep, And thro' the moss the ivies creep, And in the stream the long-leaved flowers weep, And from the craggy ledge the poppy hangs in sleep."" II Why are we weigh'd upon with heaviness, And utterly consumed with sharp distress, While all things else have rest from weariness? All things have rest: why should we toil alone, We only toil, who are the first of things, And make perpetual moan, Still from one sorrow to another thrown: Nor ever fold our wings, And cease from wanderings, Nor steep our brows in slumber's holy balm; Nor harken what the inner spirit sings, ""There is no joy but calm!"" Why should we only toil, the roof and crown of things? III Lo! in the middle of the wood, The folded leaf is woo'd from out the bud With winds upon the branch, and there Grows green and broad, and takes no care, Sun-steep'd at noon, and in the moon Nightly dew-fed; and turning yellow Falls, and floats adown the air. Lo! sweeten'd with the summer light, The full-juiced apple, waxing over-mellow, Drops in a silent autumn night. All its allotted length of days The flower ripens in its place, Ripens and fades, and falls, and hath no toil, Fast-rooted in the fruitful soil. IV Hateful is the dark-blue sky, Vaulted o'er the dark-blue sea. Death is the end of life; ah, why Should life all labour be? Let us alone. Time driveth onward fast, And in a little while our lips are dumb. Let us alone. What is it that will last? All things are taken from us, and become Portions and parcels of the dreadful past. Let us alone. What pleasure can we have To war with evil? Is there any peace In ever climbing up the climbing wave? All things have rest, and ripen toward the grave In silence; ripen, fall and cease: Give us long rest or death, dark death, or dreamful ease. V How sweet it were, hearing the downward stream, With half-shut eyes ever to seem Falling asleep in a half-dream! To dream and dream, like yonder amber light, Which will not leave the myrrh-bush on the height; To hear each other's whisper'd speech; Eating the Lotos day by day, To watch the crisping ripples on the beach, And tender curving lines of creamy spray; To lend our hearts and spirits wholly To the influence of mild-minded melancholy; To muse and brood and live again in memory, With those old faces of our infancy Heap'd over with a mound of grass, Two handfuls of white dust, shut in an urn of brass! VI Dear is the memory of our wedded lives, And dear the last embraces of our wives And their warm tears: but all hath suffer'd change: For surely now our household hearths are cold, Our sons inherit us: our looks are strange: And we should come like ghosts to trouble joy. Or else the island princes over-bold Have eat our substance, and the minstrel sings Before them of the ten years' war in Troy, And our great deeds, as half-forgotten things. Is there confusion in the little isle? Let what is broken so remain. The Gods are hard to reconcile: 'Tis hard to settle order once again. There is confusion worse than death, Trouble on trouble, pain on pain, Long labour unto aged breath, Sore task to hearts worn out by many wars And eyes grown dim with gazing on the pilot-stars. VII But, propt on beds of amaranth and moly, How sweet (while warm airs lull us, blowing lowly) With half-dropt eyelid still, Beneath a heaven dark and holy, To watch the long bright river drawing slowly His waters from the purple hill— To hear the dewy echoes calling From cave to cave thro' the thick-twined vine— To watch the emerald-colour'd water falling Thro' many a wov'n acanthus-wreath divine! Only to hear and see the far-off sparkling brine, Only to hear were sweet, stretch'd out beneath the pine. VIII The Lotos blooms below the barren peak: The Lotos blows by every winding creek: All day the wind breathes low with mellower tone: Thro' every hollow cave and alley lone Round and round the spicy downs the yellow Lotos-dust is blown. We have had enough of action, and of motion we, Roll'd to starboard, roll'd to larboard, when the surge was seething free, Where the wallowing monster spouted his foam-fountains in the sea. Let us swear an oath, and keep it with an equal mind, In the hollow Lotos-land to live and lie reclined On the hills like Gods together, careless of mankind. For they lie beside their nectar, and the bolts are hurl'd Far below them in the valleys, and the clouds are lightly curl'd Round their golden houses, girdled with the gleaming world: Where they smile in secret, looking over wasted lands, Blight and famine, plague and earthquake, roaring deeps and fiery sands, Clanging fights, and flaming towns, and sinking ships, and praying hands. But they smile, they find a music centred in a doleful song Steaming up, a lamentation and an ancient tale of wrong, Like a tale of little meaning tho' the words are strong; Chanted from an ill-used race of men that cleave the soil, Sow the seed, and reap the harvest with enduring toil, Storing yearly little dues of wheat, and wine and oil; Till they perish and they suffer—some, 'tis whisper'd—down in hell Suffer endless anguish, others in Elysian valleys dwell, Resting weary limbs at last on beds of asphodel. Surely, surely, slumber is more sweet than toil, the shore Than labour in the deep mid-ocean, wind and wave and oar; O, rest ye, brother mariners, we will not wander more.

1. brett returns my mother to the wilderness
I slipped them into my friend’s palm — 
the tiny crucifix, and dove,
from off my mother’s pendant watch — 
and I asked her to walk them up through the brush
toward timberline, and find a place
to hurl them, for safekeeping. Now,
she writes, “I walked up the canyon at dusk,
warm, with a touch of fall blowing down the canyon,
came to an outcrop, above a steep
drop — far below, a seasonal
creek, green willows. I stood on a boulder
and held out my hand. I wished your mother all the
love in the world, and I sent the talismans
flying off the cliff. They were so small,
and the wind was blowing, so I never saw or
heard them land.” My mother is where
I cannot find her, she is gone beyond
recall, she lies in her sterling shapes
light as the most weightless bone in the body, her
stirrup bone, which was ground up
and sown into the sea. I do not know
what a soul is, I think of it
as the smallest, the core, civil right. And she
is wild now with it, she touches and is
touched by no one knows — down, or
droppings of a common nighthawk,
root of bird’s foot fern, antenna of
Hairstreak or Echo Azure, or stepped on by the
huge translucent Jerusalem cricket. There was
something deeply right about
the physical elements — atoms, and cells,
and marrow — of my mother’s body,
when I was young, and now her delicate
insignias receive the direct
touch of the sun, and scatter it,
unseen, all over her home.
 
 2. cross and dove  
I had not wanted them, and I hadn’t known
what to do with them, the minuscule
symbols of my mother’s religion,
I looked for a crack in the stone floor of the
cathedral but could not find one. Then I thought
of the wilderness near Desolation,
and asked my friend to carry them up
to a peak of granite, and let the wind take them. Since
then, it has been as if my mother’s
spirit matter has been returned
into the great bank of matter,
as her marrow had been sifted down into
the ocean. It doesn’t matter, now, if I
ever wanted to disassemble
my mother. The sixteenth-of-an-inch-
across cross, and the silver line drawing
of a dove are cached, somewhere, that is nowhere
to be found. Now I think of the nature of metal, and how
long the soul-dolls of her trust will last in their
spider-egg-sac of roots, needles,
quartz, feathers, dust, snow, shed
claw. Her belief she would have an eternal
life was absolute, I think.
It would not be good to think of my mother
without her God — like a hermit howling in the
moonscape of a desert. Once, when she was old — like an
exquisite child playing a crone
in the school play — we talked about heaven.
She wasn’t sure exactly how, but she
knew her father would be there, and her elder
brother, and her second husband —
maybe it was a heaven for four,
the three men and her. It was so
easy to make my mother happy
in her last years, to tell her that I
could just see her, as a kitten, in God’s
lap, being petted. Her eyes sparkled with more
beams than any other eyes I have seen.
I have sent the tokens of her everlasting being
into the high altitude.
They will shine long after I can sing her — sing what I
perceived through the distorted prisms of my vision.
I don’t know if I saw my mother
or did not see her. Day and night,
her charms will gleam in the brush or stream, will
reflect the mountain light in little
pieces of unreadable language.

                    Nature, That Washed Her Hands in Milk
                ","
Nature, that washed her hands in milk, And had forgot to dry them, Instead of earth took snow and silk, At love’s request to try them, If she a mistress could compose To please love’s fancy out of those. Her eyes he would should be of light, A violet breath, and lips of jelly; Her hair not black, nor overbright, And of the softest down her belly; As for her inside he’d have it Only of wantonness and wit. At love’s entreaty such a one Nature made, but with her beauty She hath framed a heart of stone; So as love, by ill destiny, Must die for her whom nature gave him, Because her darling would not save him. But time (which nature doth despise, And rudely gives her love the lie, Makes hope a fool, and sorrow wise) His hands do neither wash nor dry; But being made of steel and rust, Turns snow and silk and milk to dust. The light, the belly, lips, and breath, He dims, discolors, and destroys; With those he feeds but fills not death, Which sometimes were the food of joys. Yea, time doth dull each lively wit, And dries all wantonness with it. Oh, cruel time! which takes in trust Our youth, our joys, and all we have, And pays us but with age and dust; Who in the dark and silent grave When we have wandered all our ways Shuts up the story of our days.

I have always wanted to sing a song of praise
 
for the unscathed: myself
stepping from the fractured car whose black axle’s one inch
from gone; slim pole slicing cable
 
up to sheet metal, seat foam, corduroy
(like butter, the mechanic will later
tell me, poking a stiff finger through the cloth),
to pierce the exact point
 
I was supposed to sit, stopping
because praise begins where pain
transfigures itself,
stoppered by a deeper kind of joy: so I
transfigure myself from driver
 
to survivor, the blessed Lazarine failure
 
bolting up and opening her eyes.
And here are the thousand wrecks
from a life configured in snow before me: myself,
at five, pulled from the burning car seat;
at twelve, bleeding from the scalp
after the car throws me from my bike; at fourteen,
tumbling over the slick hood rushing;
sockets of windows with glass
bashed out into a translucent, toothy ring; lights
and bumpers clipped clean off; tires burst; deer
gravitationally hurled through my windshield; brakes
given out and worse,
 
the icy loop de loops
on roads, the trucker’s 18 fat wheels squealing—
All the ways technology should have killed me
 
and didn’t.
Praise for my death-hungry luck!
And all the manner in which I’ve failed it—
marriage lost,
 
buried in the blanks of white space, my solitude
at the Greyhound station
knowing no one to retrieve me,
carless among the other pressed tight
to their own disaster or boredom—
unbearably young mothers,
 
drifters, boy soldiers
shoulder to shoulder with the insane, weaving
the same thread of conversation back and forth
between ourselves. How
 
could this happen to me
at this age, at this stage, how
did I not notice, and will you put this seat up?
and will you lend me this quarter? and will you
call me a cab when we get back home?
 
The young man in the seat before me, head
full of zigzagging tight braids says,
 Sure you can dig up that ballot box in Floridaand while you’re at it look up all the bonesburied in the Everglades, repeats it
 
for the amusement of the woman across from him,
who knows a presidential failure like she knows herself,
and when we pass my accident on the road points
and whistles, snickers:  Bet you no one walked away from that one. 
For this, and for all these things: praise
 
to the white plains of Wyoming, highway coiled
like a length of rime-colored rope; to snow
broiling in the sunlight so that the landscape
takes on a nuclear glow, so bright
 
we have to shield our eyes from it. Praise
for myself playing at morbidity
because I thought I had a right to it
 
as if flesh had to follow spirit
to such a pure depth the bones themselves
could not rest but must be broken, nerves
singed then ripped out, the heart clenched madly in its chest.
 
As if I had nothing except this white earth, this
smashed car to praise
 
what I knew before and know
even better now, the hills
cold as a hip bone and tufted with ice. Praise
to my youth and to my age, praise
 
to ambition and small-mindedness,
the kind I recognize and the kind
I am soon to recognize; praise
 
to self-hatred for it keeps me alive, and praise
for the splinters of delight that can pierce it.
Praise for wood pole, praise for glass.
Praise for muscle, praise for bone.
 
The sky is bright as a bowl on a nurse’s table today.
 
And the sun gleams into it as our bus slides by,
the light of us a wash of gold illuminating
bodies lost, bodies regained; gleaming

bloody and still beating.

Barefoot, trudging at his side, Thou hast more than he can buy In the reach of ear and eye,— Outward sunshine, inward joy: Blessings on thee, barefoot boy! Oh for boyhood’s painless play, Sleep that wakes in laughing day, Health that mocks the doctor’s rules, Knowledge never learned of schools, Of the wild bee’s morning chase, Of the wild-flower’s time and place, Flight of fowl and habitude Of the tenants of the wood; How the tortoise bears his shell, How the woodchuck digs his cell, And the ground-mole sinks his well; How the robin feeds her young, How the oriole’s nest is hung; Where the whitest lilies blow, Where the freshest berries grow, Where the ground-nut trails its vine, Where the wood-grape’s clusters shine; Of the black wasp’s cunning way, Mason of his walls of clay, And the architectural plans Of gray hornet artisans! For, eschewing books and tasks, Nature answers all he asks; Hand in hand with her he walks, Face to face with her he talks, Part and parcel of her joy,— Blessings on the barefoot boy! Oh for boyhood’s time of June, Crowding years in one brief moon, When all things I heard or saw, Me, their master, waited for. I was rich in flowers and trees, Humming-birds and honey-bees; For my sport the squirrel played, Plied the snouted mole his spade; For my taste the blackberry cone Purpled over hedge and stone; Laughed the brook for my delight Through the day and through the night, Whispering at the garden wall, Talked with me from fall to fall; Mine the sand-rimmed pickerel pond, Mine the walnut slopes beyond, Mine, on bending orchard trees, Apples of Hesperides! Still as my horizon grew, Larger grew my riches too; All the world I saw or knew Seemed a complex Chinese toy, Fashioned for a barefoot boy! Oh for festal dainties spread, Like my bowl of milk and bread; Pewter spoon and bowl of wood, On the door-stone, gray and rude! O’er me, like a regal tent, Cloudy-ribbed, the sunset bent, Purple-curtained, fringed with gold, Looped in many a wind-swung fold; While for music came the play Of the pied frogs’ orchestra; And, to light the noisy choir, Lit the fly his lamp of fire. I was monarch: pomp and joy Waited on the barefoot boy! Cheerily, then, my little man, Live and laugh, as boyhood can! Though the flinty slopes be hard, Stubble-speared the new-mown sward, Every morn shall lead thee through Fresh baptisms of the dew; Every evening from thy feet Shall the cool wind kiss the heat: All too soon these feet must hide In the prison cells of pride, Lose the freedom of the sod, Like a colt’s for work be shod, Made to tread the mills of toil, Up and down in ceaseless moil: Happy if their track be found Never on forbidden ground; Happy if they sink not in Quick and treacherous sands of sin. Ah! that thou couldst know thy joy, Ere it passes, barefoot boy!

If we meet each other in Hell it’s not Hell.
— Geoffrey Hill



i
How is it I can never find
Or call to mind
One image of Christ walking slowly in the rain,
In a steady, gentle rain,
The kind that shapes an afterimage
Just for a moment of the man
Like a cloak of shadow following
Or like a blank page
After it’s been turned?
The dead are concealed from us
But not distorted by the rain.
They remember our having remembered.
A woman curls up on the sofa.
Years before the fact she sleeps
Her death and drapes it
Even now, exactly as she must.
Just after dawn,
In the wren’s eye
There are no blossoms left in the trees,
And yet the sunlight blazons white
New flowers onto every leaf.
The wren’s eye gorges itself,
Bursting the new life.
The memory of a tree is the tree.
Christ could fly.
Impale upon him certain words
Good as Greek
For the impulse of the earth is to seek
A language of flowers
That do not die, turning
A hair’s breadth toward us
Even now, exactly as they must.
If it was justice I saw
Fall from the sun
Onto boys ruining the one
Flower shared between them,
So be it.
The woman on the sofa wears a little wing
In her sleep. When she awakes,
Its twin will be the wren in the dream
Nearly there, nearly all the way
There into the human day.
Rain falls out of brilliant sunshine.
For a moment, her window
Fills with catastrophe, boys
Torn apart and scattered, white petals
Blackening the glass,
Exacting recent justice.
So strange that the recent past,
As chaste
As antiquity, as the orangery
Of a blind eye, should at once appear
Preposterous
Yet achingly tender.
Modern times are too cautious.
The boyish, florid love of catastrophe
Has thrust a fist into the dawn,
And the scent of that fist,
Whose citron betters daylight,
Is wasted on modern times.
Not long ago, you and I
Nearly captured a wren.
Christ lifted His face then,
And rain fell all day until evening.ii
In a corner of my garden, there is a spider’s web
Entirely armored in rose petals broken off by rain.
The spider will learn to eat roses, or he will starve to death.
This is political economy for modern times.
The planet dies. The planet starves its cruel interiors
First, with a blazon of colors and soft poetry. Next,
It apportions one small bird to every tree and sets fire
To the trees. The rest is the cold business of the oceans
Who have never forgiven us for breathing air.
Homer was tempted. Loose thighs of oblivion
Welcomed humanity away from itself and from life,
And only one of the Bronze-Age host refused that welcome.
He was the father of starvation, entirely armored
In the disguise of a real man, destroyer of oceans.
We have made ugly war upon distinctions.
Canon bleeds a wedding into the gigue, and “when
I try to imagine a faultless love or” the seedtime
Of my deepest convictions — that the soul is immortal,
That a woman couched upon a fragile little wing
Created the creator of the universe — thought,
Or rather the entire machinery of truth and terror
Usurps a newborn king, i.e. imagination.
Phaedrus, step down. There is a little wing wearing sunshine
Like wind in the white hair of the bee you never imagined.
An infinitesimal distance goes on forever.
At the moment of death, the light hand of Attic stele
Softly lights upon the shoulder of eternity,
And thought yields to flesh and flesh yields to imagination,
Sexing this or that unimaginable creation
With new hair. It makes a difference. We are bound to one another
And to God by harrowing, albeit helpless distinctions,
Impossible to bridge, imperative to love well.
We are free, but briefly. The pattern of a leaf branches
Out from human hearts, and the blood spills
Into the pattern a stone makes crashing into windshields.
God follows. The wrist and wing of the beloved follow
Close behind, and not even Hell prevails against
This new extinction. Slow time is the beginning
Of no time at all. The light hand of Attic stele
Wrests me from the sleep I’d imagined life to be —
The walking stone, the irreparable Gethsemane —
And I am awake, wearing a green flesh newly fashioned
From my heart.coda
Should the bird outlast the blossom in the tree?
Keep faith, but keep it silently,
Starveling.
I keenly remember there were two of us,
And a stand of poplars like a kiss
Quavering
Upon the shade of the earth where no earth was
Ready to bear the weight of us
Relinquishing
Soul for substance, pistil of white campion
For color, continuance and one
Unbelieving
Substance of perfect memory.
There were no trees.
The sun was shining.

Make and be eaten, the poet says,Lie in the arms of nightlong fire,To celebrate the waking, wake.Burn in the daylong light; and praiseEven the mother unappeased,Even the fathers of desire.Blind go the days, but joy will see Agreements of music; they will wind The shaking of your dance; no more Will the ambiguous arm-waves spell Confusion of the blessing given. Only and finally declare Among the purest shapes of grace The waking of the face of fire, The body of waking and the skill To make your body such a shape That all the eyes of hope shall stare. That all the cries of fear shall know, Staring in their bird-pierced song; Lines of such penetration make That shall bind our loves at last. Then from the mountains of the lost, All the fantasies shall wake, Strong and real and speaking turn Wherever flickers your unreal. And my strong ghosts shall fade and pass My love start fiery as grass Wherever burn my fantasies, Wherever burn my fantasies.April 1955

They know a lot and will not forget it soon.
When did we forget? But we were never
Children, never found where they were hiding
And hid with them, never followed
The wasp down into its nest
With a fingertip that still tingles.

Remember the 1340s? We were doing a dance called the Catapult.
You always wore brown, the color craze of the decade,
and I was draped in one of those capes that were popular,
the ones with unicorns and pomegranates in needlework.
Everyone would pause for beer and onions in the afternoon,
and at night we would play a game called “Find the Cow.”
Everything was hand-lettered then, not like today.
Where has the summer of 1572 gone? Brocade and sonnet
marathons were the rage. We used to dress up in the flags
of rival baronies and conquer one another in cold rooms of stone.
Out on the dance floor we were all doing the Struggle
while your sister practiced the Daphne all alone in her room.
We borrowed the jargon of farriers for our slang.
These days language seems transparent, a badly broken code.
The 1790s will never come again. Childhood was big.
People would take walks to the very tops of hills
and write down what they saw in their journals without speaking.
Our collars were high and our hats were extremely soft.
We would surprise each other with alphabets made of twigs.
It was a wonderful time to be alive, or even dead.
I am very fond of the period between 1815 and 1821.
Europe trembled while we sat still for our portraits.
And I would love to return to 1901 if only for a moment,
time enough to wind up a music box and do a few dance steps,
or shoot me back to 1922 or 1941, or at least let me
recapture the serenity of last month when we picked
berries and glided through afternoons in a canoe.
Even this morning would be an improvement over the present.
I was in the garden then, surrounded by the hum of bees
and the Latin names of flowers, watching the early light
flash off the slanted windows of the greenhouse
and silver the limbs on the rows of dark hemlocks.
As usual, I was thinking about the moments of the past,
letting my memory rush over them like water
rushing over the stones on the bottom of a stream.
I was even thinking a little about the future, that place
where people are doing a dance we cannot imagine,
a dance whose name we can only guess.

Always it’s morning, afternoon or evening — the loot of hours — a magic sack grasping vacuum but heavy in the hand, and from which, together, we pull a swarm of telepathic bees, melons beached in a green bin, a lithograph of the city from its crumbling ramparts, crackled pitchers and the mouth of a cave.

Behold our wares, And sell us the one joy for which we wait.

House of five fires, you never raised me.
Those nights when the throat of the furnace
wheezed and rattled its regular death,
I wanted your wide door,
your mottled air of bark and working sunlight,
wanted your smokehole with its stars,
and your roof curving its singing mouth above me.
Here are the tiers once filled with sleepers,
and their low laughter measured harmony or strife.
Here I could wake amazed at winter,
my breath in the draft a chain of violets.
The house I left as a child now seems
a shell of sobs. Each year I dream it sinister
and dig in my heels to keep out the intruder
banging at the back door. My eyes burn
from cat urine under the basement stairs
and the hall reveals a nameless hunger,
as if without a history, I should always walk
the cluttered streets of this hapless continent.
Thinking it best I be wanderer,
I rode whatever river, ignoring every zigzag,
every spin. I’ve been a fragment, less than my name,
shaking in a solitary landscape,
like the last burnt leaf on an oak.
What autumn wind told me you’d be waiting?
House of five fires, they take you for a tomb,
but I know better. When desolation comes,
I’ll hide your ridgepole in my spine
and melt into crow call, reminding my children
that spiders near your door
joined all the reddening blades of grass
without oil, hasp or uranium.

We set great wreaths of brightness on the graves of the passionate who required tribute of hot July flowers— for you, O brittle-hearted, we bring offering remembering how your wrists were thin and your delicate bones not yet braced for conquering. The sharp cries of ghost-boys are keen above the meadows, and little girls continue graceful and wondering. Flickering evening on the lakes recalls those young heirs whose developing years have sunk to earth, their strength not tested, their praise unsung. Weave grasses for their childhood—who will never see love or disaster or take sides against decay balancing the choices of maturity.

1. The Ministry of Fear
       for Seamus Deane
Well, as Kavanagh said, we have lived   
In important places. The lonely scarp
Of St Columb’s College, where I billeted   
For six years, overlooked your Bogside.
I gazed into new worlds: the inflamed throat   
Of Brandywell, its floodlit dogtrack,   
The throttle of the hare. In the first week   
I was so homesick I couldn’t even eat   
The biscuits left to sweeten my exile.   
I threw them over the fence one night   
In September 1951
When the lights of houses in the Lecky Road   
Were amber in the fog. It was an act   
Of stealth.
                  Then Belfast, and then Berkeley.
Here’s two on’s are sophisticated,
Dabbling in verses till they have become   
A life: from bulky envelopes arriving   
In vacation time to slim volumes
Despatched `with the author’s compliments’.
Those poems in longhand, ripped from the wire spine   
Of your exercise book, bewildered me—
Vowels and ideas bandied free
As the seed-pods blowing off our sycamores.   
I tried to write about the sycamores
And innovated a South Derry rhyme
With hushed and lulled full chimes for pushed and pulled.   
Those hobnailed boots from beyond the mountain   
Were walking, by God, all over the fine   
Lawns of elocution.
                              Have our accents
Changed? ‘Catholics, in general, don’t speak
As well as students from the Protestant schools.’   
Remember that stuff? Inferiority
Complexes, stuff that dreams were made on.   
‘What’s your name, Heaney?’
                                          ‘Heaney, Father.’

Enough.’
             On my first day, the leather strap
Went epileptic in the Big Study,
Its echoes plashing over our bowed heads,
But I still wrote home that a boarder’s life
Was not so bad, shying as usual.
On long vacations, then, I came to life   
In the kissing seat of an Austin 16
Parked at a gable, the engine running,   
My fingers tight as ivy on her shoulders,   
A light left burning for her in the kitchen.   
And heading back for home, the summer’s   
Freedom dwindling night by night, the air   
All moonlight and a scent of hay, policemen   
Swung their crimson flashlamps, crowding round   
The car like black cattle, snuffing and pointing
The muzzle of a Sten gun in my eye:   
‘What’s your name, driver?’
                                          ‘Seamus ...’
                                                         Seamus?
They once read my letters at a roadblock
And shone their torches on your hieroglyphics,   
‘Svelte dictions’ in a very florid hand.
Ulster was British, but with no rights on   
The English lyric: all around us, though   
We hadn’t named it, the ministry of fear.2. A Constable Calls
His bicycle stood at the window-sill,   
The rubber cowl of a mud-splasher   
Skirting the front mudguard,
Its fat black handlegrips
Heating in sunlight, the ‘spud’
Of the dynamo gleaming and cocked back,   
The pedal treads hanging relieved
Of the boot of the law.
His cap was upside down
On the floor, next his chair.
The line of its pressure ran like a bevel   
In his slightly sweating hair.
He had unstrapped
The heavy ledger, and my father   
Was making tillage returns
In acres, roods, and perches.
Arithmetic and fear.

a poem that turns on his first finding Neruda's ""One Year Walk"";
he said it lit up the night like a perfect crime, so I left everything—I had no choice—walked three thousand miles to the Pacific.
From memory he recited a passage in which his father left the family
a small fortune, all counterfeit: though I doubted the facts, I can still see
that worn briefcase, almost-perfect hundreds stacked neatly in shrink-wrapped packs.

abandoned lots, through desperate patches of grass,
yellowing, past one-legged billboards of paper

I'll recite old tales to ward off the haunted

circle like red-tailed hawks, I'll recall
the tail of a comet urging you to wrap
yourself in its flames and dissolve.
Entranced by a burning equal to yours,
I'll walk eighty miles, traveling the routes

maze of upward glances.

A coyote leaped into the patients' garden
and howled under a security light
as if to say: ""I am here. Where are you?""
A roadrunner scooted across a lot,
losing one of its long tail feathers.
All this had the staff checking again

Behind them the cities dim out, on the foredeck the admirals sigh
to lean from the curving bows, to trail
their fingertips in the water . . .
All alone on the landmass, the Ship’s Artist simply draws what he sees:
red men with arms like flesh clubs, blue-daubed men with parasol feet
and fish with weeping human faces. The sonic boom arrives at his feet
in the palest ripples. In the painting, Gloriana rides under arms
towards Tilbury Town. Her profile shimmers in the sodium lights
that seem to cast no shadows before or behind her.
Like compass pencils of light, their fingertips spread out
the nervous systems more complex than spiral nebulae.
Orchards of mines grow up on the ocean floor.
Now under radar they study the green road glowing
and add a late-rising moon. The sea so full of maprooms, and the cliffs
chalked with weaponry symbols, trailing the phosphorescence of minesquads.

Now the Cathedral at Bayeux, with its window and views, is rolled up

In the morning that comes up behind the roof, in the shelter of the bridge, in the corner of  the cypresses that rise above the wall, a rooster  has crowed. In the bell tower that rips the air with its shining point, the notes ring out and already the morning din can be heard in the street; the only street that goes from the river to the mountain  dividing the woods. One looks for some other words but the ideas are always just as dark, just as simple and singularly painful. There is hardly more than the eyes, the open air, the grass and the water in the distance with, around every bend, a well or a cool basin. In the right-hand corner the last house with a larger head at the window. The trees are extremely alive and all those familiar companions walk along the demolished wall that is crushed into the thorns with bursts of laughter. Above the ravine the din augments, swells, and if the car passes on the upper road one no longer knows if it is the flowers or the little bells that are chiming. Under the blazing sun, when the landscape is on fire, the traveler crosses the stream on a very narrow bridge, before a dark hole where the trees line the water that falls asleep in the afternoon. And, against the trembling background of the woods, the motionless man.

There was a roaring in the wind all night; The rain came heavily and fell in floods; But now the sun is rising calm and bright; The birds are singing in the distant woods; Over his own sweet voice the Stock-dove broods; The Jay makes answer as the Magpie chatters; And all the air is filled with pleasant noise of waters. All things that love the sun are out of doors; The sky rejoices in the morning's birth; The grass is bright with rain-drops;—on the moors The hare is running races in her mirth; And with her feet she from the plashy earth Raises a mist, that, glittering in the sun, Runs with her all the way, wherever she doth run. I was a Traveller then upon the moor; I saw the hare that raced about with joy; I heard the woods and distant waters roar; Or heard them not, as happy as a boy: The pleasant season did my heart employ: My old remembrances went from me wholly; And all the ways of men, so vain and melancholy. But, as it sometimes chanceth, from the might Of joys in minds that can no further go, As high as we have mounted in delight In our dejection do we sink as low; To me that morning did it happen so; And fears and fancies thick upon me came; Dim sadness—and blind thoughts, I knew not, nor could name. I heard the sky-lark warbling in the sky; And I bethought me of the playful hare: Even such a happy Child of earth am I; Even as these blissful creatures do I fare; Far from the world I walk, and from all care; But there may come another day to me— Solitude, pain of heart, distress, and poverty. My whole life I have lived in pleasant thought, As if life's business were a summer mood; As if all needful things would come unsought To genial faith, still rich in genial good; But how can He expect that others should Build for him, sow for him, and at his call Love him, who for himself will take no heed at all? I thought of Chatterton, the marvellous Boy, The sleepless Soul that perished in his pride; Of Him who walked in glory and in joy Following his plough, along the mountain-side: By our own spirits are we deified: We Poets in our youth begin in gladness; But thereof come in the end despondency and madness. Now, whether it were by peculiar grace, A leading from above, a something given, Yet it befell that, in this lonely place, When I with these untoward thoughts had striven, Beside a pool bare to the eye of heaven I saw a Man before me unawares: The oldest man he seemed that ever wore grey hairs. As a huge stone is sometimes seen to lie Couched on the bald top of an eminence; Wonder to all who do the same espy, By what means it could thither come, and whence; So that it seems a thing endued with sense: Like a sea-beast crawled forth, that on a shelf Of rock or sand reposeth, there to sun itself; Such seemed this Man, not all alive nor dead, Nor all asleep—in his extreme old age: His body was bent double, feet and head Coming together in life's pilgrimage; As if some dire constraint of pain, or rage Of sickness felt by him in times long past, A more than human weight upon his frame had cast. Himself he propped, limbs, body, and pale face, Upon a long grey staff of shaven wood: And, still as I drew near with gentle pace, Upon the margin of that moorish flood Motionless as a cloud the old Man stood, That heareth not the loud winds when they call, And moveth all together, if it move at all. At length, himself unsettling, he the pond Stirred with his staff, and fixedly did look Upon the muddy water, which he conned, As if he had been reading in a book: And now a stranger's privilege I took; And, drawing to his side, to him did say, ""This morning gives us promise of a glorious day."" A gentle answer did the old Man make, In courteous speech which forth he slowly drew: And him with further words I thus bespake, ""What occupation do you there pursue? This is a lonesome place for one like you."" Ere he replied, a flash of mild surprise Broke from the sable orbs of his yet-vivid eyes. His words came feebly, from a feeble chest, But each in solemn order followed each, With something of a lofty utterance drest— Choice word and measured phrase, above the reach Of ordinary men; a stately speech; Such as grave Livers do in Scotland use, Religious men, who give to God and man their dues. He told, that to these waters he had come To gather leeches, being old and poor: Employment hazardous and wearisome! And he had many hardships to endure: From pond to pond he roamed, from moor to moor; Housing, with God's good help, by choice or chance; And in this way he gained an honest maintenance. The old Man still stood talking by my side; But now his voice to me was like a stream Scarce heard; nor word from word could I divide; And the whole body of the Man did seem Like one whom I had met with in a dream; Or like a man from some far region sent, To give me human strength, by apt admonishment. My former thoughts returned: the fear that kills; And hope that is unwilling to be fed; Cold, pain, and labour, and all fleshly ills; And mighty Poets in their misery dead. —Perplexed, and longing to be comforted, My question eagerly did I renew, ""How is it that you live, and what is it you do?"" He with a smile did then his words repeat; And said that, gathering leeches, far and wide He travelled; stirring thus about his feet The waters of the pools where they abide. ""Once I could meet with them on every side; But they have dwindled long by slow decay; Yet still I persevere, and find them where I may."" While he was talking thus, the lonely place, The old Man's shape, and speech—all troubled me: In my mind's eye I seemed to see him pace About the weary moors continually, Wandering about alone and silently. While I these thoughts within myself pursued, He, having made a pause, the same discourse renewed. And soon with this he other matter blended, Cheerfully uttered, with demeanour kind, But stately in the main; and, when he ended, I could have laughed myself to scorn to find In that decrepit Man so firm a mind. ""God,"" said I, ""be my help and stay secure; I'll think of the Leech-gatherer on the lonely moor!""

I hate the travel logs that tell you
more about the pain than the place,
yet here I am again, narrating
 
the same old story to myself
time after time. The papers circling
in an alley, watched by a hunchback,
 
mimic my plans and their preventer;
when an old man treats the drycleaner
to a lengthy sermon on spotting,
 
I collect it; bloated clouds spell
messages that people stopped hearing
long ago, and as for the hag
 
who runs at me, arms open, mouth bleeding?
She’s my future, my terrible double.
Always I head out, hot for details,
 
and always the details start revolving
around brave ingénues who put their
innocent hands in wicked bonfires.
 
I could never go for ten minutes
without seeing fissures as faces,
and I confess a hopeless weakness
 
for the types who come back from travels,
gather their fans around and tell them
stories of order or of wonder:
 
seashores and meadows sometimes get so
muffled and many-voiced that tourists
storm in and do their talking for them—
 
It’s addictive, magical, vital.
But I’ve observed how, more and more, these
promising outings are becoming
 
meta-walks and mechanized phrases:
“When I ventured into the outback,
how it blared back echoes of me,
 
my bright dreams and tragic uniqueness.”
Meanwhile forces of good and evil
squirm and flourish under the carpet,
 
mocking the visionary moment’s
sweeping appeal. I’ll go on going
out for scenes of horror and pleasure,
 
but I’ll start pursuing clues leading
to the return of that enormous,
fertile ground between shouting and silence.

When first I walked here I hobbled   
along ties set too close together   
for a boy to step easily on each.   
I thought my stride one day
would reach every other and from then on   
I would walk in time with the way   
toward that Lobachevskian haze   
up ahead where the two rails meet.   
Here we put down our pennies, dark,   
on shined steel; they trembled, fell still;   
then the locomotive out of Attleboro
rattling its berserk wheel-rods into perfect circles,   
brightened them into wafers, the way a fork   
mashes into view the inner light of a carrot   
in a stew. In this late March sunshine,   
crossing the trees at the angle of a bow   
when it effleurages out of the chanterelle   
the C three octaves above middle C,   
the vertical birthwood remembers   
its ascent lines, shrunken by half, exactly   
back down, each tree on its fallen summer.   
Back then, these rocks often asked   
blood offerings—but this one, once, asked bone,   
the time Billy Wallace tripped and broke out
his front teeth. Fitted with gold replicas,
he asked, speaking more brightly, “What good   
are golden teeth, given what we’ve got
to eat?” Nebuchadnezzar
spent seven years down on all fours   
eating vetch and alfalfa, ruminating
the mouth-feel of “bloom” and “wither,”   
until he was whole. If you
held a grass blade between both thumbs   
and blew hard you could blurt a shriek   
out of it—like that beseeching leaves oaks   
didn’t drop last winter just now scratch   
on a breeze. Maybe Billy, lured
by bones’ memory, comes back
sometimes, too, to the Seekonk Woods,   
to stand in the past and just look at it.
Here he might kneel, studying this clump of grass,
as a god might inspect the strands of a human sneeze   
that percusses through. Or he might stray   
into the now untrafficked whistling-lanes   
of the mourning doves, who used to call and call   
into the future, and give a start, as though,   
this very minute, by awful coincidence,   
they reach it. And at last traipse off
down the tracks, with arrhythmic gait,   
as wanderers must do once they realize:   
the over-the-unknown route, too, ends up   
where time wants. On this spot
I skinned the muskrat. The musk breezed away.   
I buried the rat. Of the fur
I made a hat, which as soon as put on   
began to rot off, causing my scalp to crawl.   
In circles, of course, keeping to the skull.
One day could this scrap of damp skin
crawl all the way off, and the whole organism   
follow? To do what? Effuse with musk,   
or rot with rat? When, a quarter-
turn after the sun, the half-moon,   
too, goes down and we find ourselves   
in the night's night, then somewhere   
hereabouts in the dark must be death.   
Knowledge of it beforehand is surely among   
existence’s most spectacular feats—and yet right here,   
on this ordinary afternoon, in these woods,   
with a name meaning “black goose” in Wampanoag,   
or in modern Seekonkese, “slob blowing fat nose,”
this unlikely event happens—a creature   
walking the tracks knows it will come.   
Then too long to touch every tie, his stride   
is now just too short to reach every other,
and so he is to be still the wanderer, the hirtle   
of too much replaced by the common limp   
of too little. But he almost got there.
Almost stepped in consonance with the liturgical,   
sleeping gods’ snores you can hear humming up
from former times inside the ties. He almost   
set foot in that border zone where what follows   
blows back, shimmering everything, making   
walking like sleepwalking, railroad tracks   
a country lane on a spring morning,   
on which a man, limping but blissful,   
makes his way homeward, his lips, suppled   
by kissing to bunch up like that, blowing
these short strands of hollowed-out air,   
haunted by future, into a tune on the tracks.   
I think I’m about to be shocked awake.
As I was in childhood, when I battered myself   
back to my senses against a closed door,
or woke up hanging out of an upstairs window.   
Somnambulism was my attempt to slip
under cover of nightmare across no father’s land   
and embrace a phantasm. If only
I had found a way to enter his hard time   
served at labor by day, by night in solitary,   
and put my arms around him in reality,   
I might not now be remaking him
in memory still; anti-alchemizing bass kettle’s   
golden reverberations back down
to hair, flesh, blood, bone, the base metals.   
I want to crawl face down in the fields
and graze on the wild strawberries, my clothes   
stained pink, even for seven years   
if I must, if they exist. I want to lie out
on my back under the thousand stars and think   
my way up among them, through them,   
and a little distance past them, and attain   
a moment of absolute ignorance,
if I can, if human mentality lets us.
I have always intended to live forever;
but not until now, to live now. The moment   
I have done one or the other, I here swear,   
no one will have to drag me , I’ll come   
but never will I agree to burn my words.
The poplar logs creosoted asleep under the tracks   
have stopped snoring. Maybe they’ve   
already waked up. The bow saws at G.   
An oak leaf rattles on its tree. The rails   
may never meet, O fellow Euclideans,   
for you, for me. So what if we groan.   
That’s our noise. Laughter is our stuttering   
in a language we can’t speak yet. Behind,   
the world made of wishes goes dark. Ahead,   
if not now then never, shines what is.

    in the airport terminal I sit down in a row of chairs without looking at the man in the chair beside me… my chair is adjacent to a narrow formica table where I set the coffee and muffin I’ve bought… I’m tempted to look at the man sitting on the other side of the formica table but I do not want to take a chance and meet his eyes… a familiar animosity must be what warns me off… warnings that I realize are chewable I’m learning are better swallowed… I watch how this man expresses affront toward me without interrupting his focus on his cell phone… the formica table between us isn’t wide enough for him to have the distance from me he requires… this next  sensation has nothing to do with what he knows… though I react as if it could… his disgust is my own as I lie on my side my knees to my chest… in a bed I am a child with my mother her body moving… her body wrapped too close around me… nothing about this should surprise me… nothing is the space between one breath and the next… even if the space is decades long…

That autumn was abundant
In Istanbul the ancient and platinum
Women with their faces covered and discovered
My grandfather arrived on foot to this Ottoman city
From the desolate Sebastopol and from other burned villages,
From the bloody snow.
He spoke about its minarets
Certainly he loved the fields of leaves. Autumn, like a river or
    a glowing bonfire
And I don't know where he went to pray,
Or perhaps he no longer did so in the city of the sultans
But I know in his mouth he carried a needle
Noble metaphor of his trade.
Perhaps he wandered astonished throughout lovely Istanbul
Searching for sustenance or clients
Perhaps inclined, he entered one of the thousand mosques
Where he prayed
While the clocks stood still,
Geographies were erased.
Because the city was merely a golden breeze falling upon the
     leaves
A multitude of lights upon the holy minarets,
My grandfather,
A Jewish tailor also took refuge in Istanbul
Also another small Jewish city
Among the thresholds of history.

The Seneca carry stories in satchels.
They are made of  pounded corn and a grandmother’s throat.
The right boy will approach the dampness of a forest with a sling, a modest twining wreath for the bodies of  birds. A liquid eye.
When ruffed from leaves, the breath of  flight is dissolute.
What else, the moment of  weightlessness before a great plunge?
In a lost place, a stone will find the boy.
Give me your birds, she will say, and I will tell you a story.
A stone, too, admits hunger.
The boy is willing. Loses all his beaks.
What necklace will his grandmother make now.
The sun has given the stone a mouth. With it, she sings of what has been lost.
She sings and sings and sings.
The boy listens, forgets, remembers. Becomes distracted.
The necklace will be heavy, impossible to wear.

What you wanted from me was complex
and simple, both. Once you asked for more
than I had to give. I live
with this; call it regret. Your hands bloom
in the intaglioed scrawl, creased onion skin tattooed
with garnet stamps from Pietrasanta,
a sifting of marble dust...Images: chiseled
jut of jaw, cheek, bridge of nose—recall
each granite face rising from New Hampshire
dirt upon which faltering, you last stepped.

to be, Reiner Ottens dragged his fine tip

lobster, serpent, bison, dove bearing the requisite
sprig—swirl and writhe over lines that pin
distance and story to time.
Spectral creatures that we are, connecting dots

For all the far-flung continents he'd crossed, Revealing lands they found beyond belief; For all the roads that lay behind him, lost In caverns of some atavistic grief He'd carried with him since he was a boy; For all the years, he should be weary now. How then could he explain this welling joy, A old man on a wintry beach? Or how It seemed the wind bore perfumes of a whole New wilderness, a lush and green Brazil Over the dim horizon of his soul, Farther than memory, beyond his will, Where even now, in vibrant canopies, The twilight songs of bird to hidden bird Rose up in wild, untutored harmonies More lovely for their never being heard.

Crows see us as another invention. Like summer and beauty, They shimmer at sunrise in their new cars,Change their names and color when they see us. When they fly, they’re the bite marks on the sun,And nail-scratches of black against the sky. We matter little to them as we are.They prefer hamburger, youth, Oxygen and mineral water.And, of course, we sell our souls to a passing crow, Because we’re shiny things they take to heaven.Crows are always polite to humans.They have lots of money And live at a party that never ends.We’re the junk genes they left behind, That play Aztec football with our heads,When we dream and lose. Crows have relatives everywhere.Human warfare moves across the sky Making more room for them to fly.We’re just a meal in the next world. We’re the hole in the sky.Crows are legends and instructors of grace.They are the dots in the fog, And the flight of the uterus.Crows are the printed warningsOf a wasted life. They will never leave or abandon us.When we take our last breath,Navigating through our mistakes and lies, The crows will take our last word.We are the last citizens of a pale race of crows,Rearranging the furniture in the mind of God. Crows turn the planet on its axis when we die,And do nothing to the body we’ll remember. Our souls are their meal of the day.And the blue marble in its beak, As it flies away,Is the world leaving you.

On a road through the mountains with a friend many years ago
   I came to a curve on a slope where a clear stream flowed down flashing across dark rocks through its own
   echoes that could neither be caught nor forgotten it was the turning of autumn and already
   the mornings were cold with ragged clouds in the hollowslong after sunrise but the pasture sagging like a roof 
   the glassy water and flickering yellow leavesin the few poplars and knotted plum trees were held up
   in a handful of sunlight that made the slates on the silentmill by the stream glisten white above their ruin
   and a few relics of the life before had been arrangedin front of the open mill house to wait
   pale in the daylight out on the open mountainafter whatever they had been made for was over
   the dew was drying on them and there were few who took that roadwho might buy one of them and take it away somewhere 
   to be unusual to be the only oneto become unknown a wooden bed stood there on rocks
   a cradle the color of dust a cracked oil jar iron pots wooden wheels iron wheels stone wheels the tall box of a clock
   and among them a ring of white stone the size of an embrace set into another of the same size
   an iron spike rising from the ring where the woodenhandle had fitted that turned it in its days as a hand mill 
   you could see if you looked closely that the top ringthat turned in the other had been carved long before in the form 
   of a fox lying nose in tail seeming to beasleep the features worn almost away where it
   had gone around and around grinding grain and salt to go into the dark and to go on and remember
   * * *What I thought I had left I kept finding again
   but when I went looking for what I thought I rememberedas anyone could have foretold it was not there
   when I went away looking for what I had to do I found that I was living where I was a stranger
   but when I retraced my steps the familiar visionturned opaque and all surface and in the wrong places
   and the places where I had been a stranger appeared to me to be where I had been at home called by name and answering
   getting ready to go away and going away
   * * *Every time they assembled and he spoke to them
   about waking there was an old man who stood listening and left before the others until one day the old man stayed
   and Who are you he asked the old manand the old man answered I am not a man
   many lives ago I stood where you are standingand they assembled in front of me and I spoke to them 
   about waking until one day one of them asked meWhen someone has wakened to what is really there 
   is that person free of the chain of consequencesand I answered yes and with that I turned into a fox
   and I have been a fox for five hundred livesand now I have come to ask you to say what will 
   free me from the body of a fox please tell mewhen someone has wakened to what is really there 
   is that person free of the chain of consequencesand this time the answer was That person sees it as it is 
   then the old man said Thank you for waking meyou have set me free of the body of the fox
   which you will find on the other side of the mountainI ask you to bury it please as one of your own 
   that evening he announced a funeral servicefor one of them but they said nobody has died
   then he led them to the other side of the mountainand a cave where they found a fox’s body
   and he told them the story and they buried the fox as one of them but later one of them asked
   what if he had given the right answer every time
   * * *Once again I was there and once again I was leaving

   was a time of ending this time the long marriage was overthe orbits were flying apart it was autumn again 
   sunlight tawny in the fields where the shadowseach day grew longer and the still afternoons
   ripened the distance until the sun went downacross the valley and the full moon rose out of the trees
   it was the time of year when I was born and that eveningI went to see friends for the last time and I came back 
   after midnight along the road white with the moonI was crossing the bars of shadow and seeing ahead of me 
   the wide silent valley full of silver lightand there just at the corner of the land that I had
   come back to so many times and now was leaving at the foot of the wall built of pale stone I saw the body
   stretched in the grass and it was a fox a vixen just dead with no sign of how it had come to happen
   no blood the long fur warm in the dewy grass nothing broken or lost or torn or unfinished
   I carried her home to bury her in the gardenin the morning of the clear autumn that she had left 
   and to stand afterward in the turning daylight
   * * *There are the yellow beads of the stonecrops and the twisted flags 
   of dried irises knuckled into the hollowsof moss and rubbly limestone on the waves of the low wall
   the ivy has climbed along them where the weasel ran the light has kindled to gold the late leaves of the cherry tree
   over the lane by the house chimney there is the roof and the window looking out over the garden
   summer and winter there is the field below the housethere is the broad valley far below them all with the curves 
   of the river a strand of sky threaded through itand the notes of bells rising out of it faint as smoke
   and there beyond the valley above the rim of the wallthe line of mountains I recognize like a line of writing
   that has come back when I had thought it was forgotten

                    The Building of the Ship
                ","
""Build me straight, O worthy Master! Stanch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"" The merchant's word Delighted the Master heard; For his heart was in his work, and the heart Giveth grace unto every Art. A quiet smile played round his lips, As the eddies and dimples of the tide Play round the bows of ships, That steadily at anchor ride. And with a voice that was full of glee, He answered, ""Erelong we will launch A vessel as goodly, and strong, and stanch, As ever weathered a wintry sea!"" And first with nicest skill and art, Perfect and finished in every part, A little model the Master wrought, Which should be to the larger plan What the child is to the man, Its counterpart in miniature; That with a hand more swift and sure The greater labor might be brought To answer to his inward thought. And as he labored, his mind ran o'er The various ships that were built of yore, And above them all, and strangest of all Towered the Great Harry, crank and tall, Whose picture was hanging on the wall, With bows and stern raised high in air, And balconies hanging here and there, And signal lanterns and flags afloat, And eight round towers, like those that frown From some old castle, looking down Upon the drawbridge and the moat. And he said with a smile, ""Our ship, I wis, Shall be of another form than this!"" It was of another form, indeed; Built for freight, and yet for speed, A beautiful and gallant craft; Broad in the beam, that the stress of the blast, Pressing down upon sail and mast, Might not the sharp bows overwhelm; Broad in the beam, but sloping aft With graceful curve and slow degrees, That she might be docile to the helm, And that the currents of parted seas, Closing behind, with mighty force, Might aid and not impede her course. In the ship-yard stood the Master, With the model of the vessel, That should laugh at all disaster, And with wave and whirlwind wrestle! Covering many a rood of ground, Lay the timber piled around; Timber of chestnut, and elm, and oak, And scattered here and there, with these, The knarred and crooked cedar knees; Brought from regions far away, From Pascagoula's sunny bay, And the banks of the roaring Roanoke! Ah! what a wondrous thing it is To note how many wheels of toil One thought, one word, can set in motion! There 's not a ship that sails the ocean, But every climate, every soil, Must bring its tribute, great or small, And help to build the wooden wall! The sun was rising o'er the sea, And long the level shadows lay, As if they, too, the beams would be Of some great, airy argosy, Framed and launched in a single day. That silent architect, the sun, Had hewn and laid them every one, Ere the work of man was yet begun. Beside the Master, when he spoke, A youth, against an anchor leaning, Listened, to catch his slightest meaning. Only the long waves, as they broke In ripples on the pebbly beach, Interrupted the old man's speech. Beautiful they were, in sooth, The old man and the fiery youth! The old man, in whose busy brain Many a ship that sailed the main Was modelled o'er and o'er again; — The fiery youth, who was to be The heir of his dexterity, The heir of his house, and his daughter's hand, When he had built and launched from land What the elder head had planned. ""Thus,"" said he, ""will we build this ship! Lay square the blocks upon the slip, And follow well this plan of mine. Choose the timbers with greatest care; Of all that is unsound beware; For only what is sound and strong To this vessel shall belong. Cedar of Maine and Georgia pine Here together shall combine. A goodly frame, and a goodly fame, And the Union be her name! For the day that gives her to the sea Shall give my daughter unto thee!"" The Master's word Enraptured the young man heard; And as he turned his face aside, With a look of joy and a thrill of pride Standing before Her father's door, He saw the form of his promised bride. The sun shone on her golden hair, And her cheek was glowing fresh and fair, With the breath of morn and the soft sea air. Like a beauteous barge was she, Still at rest on the sandy beach, Just beyond the billow's reach; But he Was the restless, seething, stormy sea! Ah, how skilful grows the hand That obeyeth Love's command! It is the heart, and not the brain, That to the highest doth attain, And he who followeth Love's behest Far excelleth all the rest! Thus with the rising of the sun Was the noble task begun, And soon throughout the ship-yard's bounds Were heard the intermingled sounds Of axes and of mallets, plied With vigorous arms on every side; Plied so deftly and so well, That, ere the shadows of evening fell, The keel of oak for a noble ship, Scarfed and bolted, straight and strong, Was lying ready, and stretched along The blocks, well placed upon the slip. Happy, thrice happy, every one Who sees his labor well begun, And not perplexed and multiplied, By idly waiting for time and tide! And when the hot, long day was o'er, The young man at the Master's door Sat with the maiden calm and still, And within the porch, a little more Removed beyond the evening chill, The father sat, and told them tales Of wrecks in the great September gales, Of pirates coasting the Spanish Main, And ships that never came back again, The chance and change of a sailor's life, Want and plenty, rest and strife, His roving fancy, like the wind, That nothing can stay and nothing can bind, And the magic charm of foreign lands, With shadows of palms, and shining sands, Where the tumbling surf, O'er the coral reefs of Madagascar, Washes the feet of the swarthy Lascar, As he lies alone and asleep on the turf. And the trembling maiden held her breath At the tales of that awful, pitiless sea, With all its terror and mystery, The dim, dark sea, so like unto Death, That divides and yet unites mankind! And whenever the old man paused, a gleam From the bowl of his pipe would awhile illume The silent group in the twilight gloom, And thoughtful faces, as in a dream; And for a moment one might mark What had been hidden by the dark, That the head of the maiden lay at rest, Tenderly, on the young man's breast! Day by day the vessel grew, With timbers fashioned strong and true, Stemson and keelson and sternson-knee, Till, framed with perfect symmetry, A skeleton ship rose up to view! And around the bows and along the side The heavy hammers and mallets plied, Till after many a week, at length, Wonderful for form and strength, Sublime in its enormous bulk, Loomed aloft the shadowy hulk! And around it columns of smoke, upwreathing, Rose from the boiling, bubbling, seething Caldron, that glowed, And overflowed With the black tar, heated for the sheathing. And amid the clamors Of clattering hammers, He who listened heard now and then The song of the Master and his men: — ""Build me straight, O worthy Master,       Staunch and strong, a goodly vessel, That shall laugh at all disaster,       And with wave and whirlwind wrestle!"" With oaken brace and copper band, Lay the rudder on the sand, That, like a thought, should have control Over the movement of the whole; And near it the anchor, whose giant hand Would reach down and grapple with the land, And immovable and fast Hold the great ship against the bellowing blast! And at the bows an image stood, By a cunning artist carved in wood, With robes of white, that far behind Seemed to be fluttering in the wind. It was not shaped in a classic mould, Not like a Nymph or Goddess of old, Or Naiad rising from the water, But modelled from the Master's daughter! On many a dreary and misty night, 'T will be seen by the rays of the signal light, Speeding along through the rain and the dark, Like a ghost in its snow-white sark, The pilot of some phantom bark, Guiding the vessel, in its flight, By a path none other knows aright! Behold, at last, Each tall and tapering mast Is swung into its place; Shrouds and stays Holding it firm and fast! Long ago, In the deer-haunted forests of Maine, When upon mountain and plain Lay the snow, They fell, — those lordly pines! Those grand, majestic pines! 'Mid shouts and cheers The jaded steers, Panting beneath the goad, Dragged down the weary, winding road Those captive kings so straight and tall, To be shorn of their streaming hair, And naked and bare, To feel the stress and the strain Of the wind and the reeling main, Whose roar Would remind them forevermore Of their native forests they should not see again. And everywhere The slender, graceful spars Poise aloft in the air, And at the mast-head, White, blue, and red, A flag unrolls the stripes and stars. Ah! when the wanderer, lonely, friendless, In foreign harbors shall behold That flag unrolled, 'T will be as a friendly hand Stretched out from his native land, Filling his heart with memories sweet and endless! All is finished! and at length Has come the bridal day Of beauty and of strength. To-day the vessel shall be launched! With fleecy clouds the sky is blanched, And o'er the bay, Slowly, in all his splendors dight, The great sun rises to behold the sight. The ocean old, Centuries old, Strong as youth, and as uncontrolled, Paces restless to and fro, Up and down the sands of gold. His beating heart is not at rest; And far and wide, With ceaseless flow, His beard of snow Heaves with the heaving of his breast. He waits impatient for his bride. There she stands, With her foot upon the sands, Decked with flags and streamers gay, In honor of her marriage day, Her snow-white signals fluttering, blending, Round her like a veil descending, Ready to be The bride of the gray old sea. On the deck another bride Is standing by her lover's side. Shadows from the flags and shrouds, Like the shadows cast by clouds, Broken by many a sunny fleck, Fall around them on the deck. The prayer is said, The service read, The joyous bridegroom bows his head; And in tears the good old Master Shakes the brown hand of his son, Kisses his daughter's glowing cheek In silence, for he cannot speak, And ever faster Down his own the tears begin to run. The worthy pastor — The shepherd of that wandering flock, That has the ocean for its wold, That has the vessel for its fold, Leaping ever from rock to rock — Spake, with accents mild and clear, Words of warning, words of cheer, But tedious to the bridegroom's ear. He knew the chart Of the sailor's heart, All its pleasures and its griefs, All its shallows and rocky reefs, All those secret currents, that flow With such resistless undertow, And lift and drift, with terrible force, The will from its moorings and its course. Therefore he spake, and thus said he: — ""Like unto ships far off at sea, Outward or homeward bound, are we. Before, behind, and all around, Floats and swings the horizon's bound, Seems at its distant rim to rise And climb the crystal wall of the skies, And then again to turn and sink, As if we could slide from its outer brink. Ah! it is not the sea, It is not the sea that sinks and shelves, But ourselves That rock and rise With endless and uneasy motion, Now touching the very skies, Now sinking into the depths of ocean. Ah! if our souls but poise and swing Like the compass in its brazen ring, Ever level and ever true To the toil and the task we have to do, We shall sail securely, and safely reach The Fortunate Isles, on whose shining beach The sights we see, and the sounds we hear, Will be those of joy and not of fear!"" Then the Master, With a gesture of command, Waved his hand; And at the word, Loud and sudden there was heard, All around them and below, The sound of hammers, blow on blow, Knocking away the shores and spurs. And see! she stirs! She starts, — she moves, — she seems to feel The thrill of life along her keel, And, spurning with her foot the ground, With one exulting, joyous bound, She leaps into the ocean's arms! And lo! from the assembled crowd There rose a shout, prolonged and loud, That to the ocean seemed to say, ""Take her, O bridegroom, old and gray, Take her to thy protecting arms, With all her youth and all her charms!"" How beautiful she is! How fair She lies within those arms, that press Her form with many a soft caress Of tenderness and watchful care! Sail forth into the sea, O ship! Through wind and wave, right onward steer! The moistened eye, the trembling lip, Are not the signs of doubt or fear. Sail forth into the sea of life, O gentle, loving, trusting wife, And safe from all adversity Upon the bosom of that sea Thy comings and thy goings be! For gentleness and love and trust Prevail o'er angry wave and gust; And in the wreck of noble lives Something immortal still survives! Thou, too, sail on, O Ship of State! Sail on, O Union, strong and great! Humanity with all its fears, With all the hopes of future years, Is hanging breathless on thy fate! We know what Master laid thy keel, What Workmen wrought thy ribs of steel, Who made each mast, and sail, and rope, What anvils rang, what hammers beat, In what a forge and what a heat Were shaped the anchors of thy hope! Fear not each sudden sound and shock, 'T is of the wave and not the rock; 'T is but the flapping of the sail, And not a rent made by the gale! In spite of rock and tempest's roar, In spite of false lights on the shore, Sail on, nor fear to breast the sea! Our hearts, our hopes, are all with thee, Our hearts, our hopes, our prayers, our tears, Our faith triumphant o'er our fears, Are all with thee, — are all with thee!

Pitiful brother—the dreadful nights I owed him! “I’ve got no real involvement in the business. I toyed with his weakness, so—it was my fault—we wound up back in exile and enslavement.”
He saw me as a loser, a weird child; he added his own prods.
I answered my satanic doctor, jeering, and made it out the window. All down a landscape crossed by unheard-of music, I spun my dreams of a nighttime wealth to come.
After that more or less healthy pastime, I’d stretch out on a pallet. And almost every night, soon as I slept, my poor brother would rise—dry mouth and bulging eyes (the way he’d dreamt himself!)—and haul me into the room, howling his stupid dream.
Truly convinced, I’d vowed to take him back to his primal state—child of the sun—and so we wandered, fed on wine from the caves and gypsy bread, me bound to find the place itself and the code.

In this part of China everything is made from the earth:

the houses, the walls around cities, and villages,

the tombs scattered over the countryside.

Even the people.

 

There are hills below that appear to be piles of mud

set out to dry in the sun, naked,

without a single tree or bush.

They crowd around the landscape

like the coils of bulging intestines

tossed on the ground outside butchers' shops,

slowly unraveling.

 

Sometimes we fly so low that we almost touch them.

 

And then I notice that the wind has brushed

some kind of pattern into the earth: a mysterious alphabet

written in the mud,

struggling to communicate something precise.

But there is not a single animal

or human being in the yellow desert below.

 

Not a single village. 
Suddenly we are landing: Xian,
the geographic center of China,
where Chinese civilization was born,
in the cradle of the Yellow River.
 
In front of the terminal,
three children are playing with a lump of earth:
they are bundled up in jackets
and brightly printed cotton trousers.
I join them in their game
until a young woman comes out of the terminal
to call me in for dinner.
One of the children grabs me by my overcoat,
to keep me from leaving.
So do the other two, clinging to me,
asking me not to go.
 
The young woman comes out again,

They let go, disappointed.
One of them calls to me as I turn away:Come back soon! 
We eat quickly and then prepare to take off for Lanchow.
My three new friends wave goodbye to me. The littlest one

a precious gift.
In this part of China there are no stones.
You have to go to Karelia to find stone,
very far north; or to the Caucasus;
or to southern Siberia, along the slopes of the Pamir,
slanting toward the steppes of Central Asia. 
I put the pebble in my pocket,
to take back home, to show what a precious gift
I was given by a little Chinese girl: a pebble
from the cradle of Chinese civilization. 
A civilization made of earth,
a civilization without bones,
without a skeleton for support.
A civilization of assembled customs,
which suddenly unravel,
dissolving into thousands of separate gestures,
thousands of calligraphic icons,
thousands of smells, colors, flavors,
thousands of different shades. And then just as suddenly
they solidify again into tradition, memory, habit. 
It is this absence of stone, of solid, durable material,
which makes China such an exquisite thing.
Everything is reflected:
an unimaginable number of movements,
of patterns, thoughts, images,
of which we see the copies in immense numbers,
but never the originals. 
The originals were destroyed long ago. 
Here are the four elements out of which China is made:
Earth, Wood, Porcelain, Silk.
The most durable of these is Silk. 
I should add a fifth element: Poetry,
which is the most durable of all.

lay far beyond belief — daytime terrors, waking dreamtime,
the lock-up, breeze-block walls, chain-drag, the Black & Decker
kicking in: winged creatures, they sing as they work.
Dust and shadow, come back to that, come back with a heavy heart.
Is there nothing more: is that what you heard yourself say?
Children in the garden, the headlong rush, the wolf pack
between trees and snowfall under moonlight: the story you told

He untangled the thing that had snagged in her hair, his hand
through a spectrum, spectral, blurring, a rail of fingers,
to lift the thing in her hair. It would rain that day: cloud low
to the hills, morning as nightfall, her window open to that.
Slow sacrament of cheese and olive oil and bread, the creep
of sundown-sunlight on the wall. “How safe do you feel
at times like this?” Laughing, he bared his teeth. A thing flew in
at the open window, bird or bat. “It’s like looking at clear water
through clouded glass.” They were far off from anywhere.
A salted seam, just fool’s gold, leavings of a dream wherein
you give a true report of who you were, of what you could become.
In rainfall you’re invisible, in sunlight the same, that’s all
the dream gives up: a sense of place and sudden banishment.

For Rafael Heliodoro Valle



I set out from the Port of Acapulco on the twenty-third of March
And kept a steady course until Saturday, the fourth of April, when
A half hour before dawn, we saw by the light of the moon
That a ship had come alongside
With sails and a bow that seemed to be of silver.
Our helmsman cried out to them to stand off
But no one answered, as though they were all asleep.
Again we called out: “WHERE DID THEIR SHIP COME FROM?”
And they said: Peru!
After which we heard trumpets, and muskets firing,
And they ordered me to come down into their longboat
To cross over to where their Captain was.
I found him walking the deck,
Went up to him, kissed his hands and he asked me:
“What silver or gold I had aboard that ship?”
I said, “None at all,
None at all, My Lord, only my dishes and cups.”
So then he asked me if I knew the Viceroy.
I said I did. And I asked the Captain,
“If he were Captain Drake himself and no other?”
The Captain replied that
“He was the very Drake I spoke of.”
We spoke together a long time, until the hour of dinner,
And he commanded that I sit by his side.
His dishes and cups are of silver, bordered with gold
With his crest upon them.
He has with him many perfumes and scented waters in crystal vials
Which, he said, the Queen had given him.
He dines and sups always with music of violins
And also takes with him everywhere painters who keep painting
All the coast for him.
He is a man of some twenty-four years, small, with a reddish beard.
He is a nephew of Juan Aquinas,* the pirate.
And is one of the greatest mariners there are upon the sea.
The day after, which was Sunday, he clothed himself in splendid garments
And had them hoist all their flags
With pennants of divers colors at the mastheads,
The bronze rings, and chains, and the railings and
The lights on the Alcazar shining like gold.
His ship was like a gold dragon among the dolphins.
And we went, with his page, to my ship to look at the coffers.
All day long until night he spent looking at what I had.
What he took from me was not much,
A few trifles of my own,
And he gave me a cutlass and a silver brassart for them,
Asking me to forgive him
Since it was for his lady that he was taking them:
He would let me go, he said, the next morning, as soon as there was a breeze;
For this I thanked him, and kissed his hands.
He is carrying, in his galleon, three thousand bars of silver
Three coffers full of gold
Twelve great coffers of pieces of eight:
And he says he is heading for China
Following the charts and steered by a Chinese pilot whom he captured ...

(A Reincarnation Phantasy)



This was the story never told
By one who cared not for the world’s gold.
One of the idle and wise,
A beggar with unfathomable eyes.
One who had nothing but dreams to give
To men who are eager to labour and live.
For the world in its wisdom deep and dim
Had taken all pleasure and treasure from him.
This was the story his soul could tell,
Immortal and unfathomable.
There was no record in his brain,
He did not know he should live again.
But there was one who read the whole,
Buried deep in a dead man’s soul.
“In the days of Atlantis, under the wave,
I was a slave, the child of a slave.
When the towers of Atlantis fell,
I died and was born again in hell.
From that sorrowful prison I did escape
And hid myself in a hero’s shape.
But few years had I of love or joy,
A Trojan I fell at the Siege of Troy.
I came again in a little while,
An Israelite slave on the banks of the Nile.
Then did I comfort my grief-laden heart.
With the magic lore and Egyptian art.
Fain was I to become Osiris then,
But soon I came back to the world of men.
By the Ganges I was an outcast born,
A wanderer and a child of scorn.
By the Waters of Babylon I wept,
My harp amongst the willows slept.
In the land of Greece I opened my eyes,
To reap the fields of Plotinus the Wise.
When the great light shattered the world’s closed bars,
I was a shepherd who gazed at the stars.
For lives that were lonely, obscure, apart,
I thank the Hidden One, in my heart,
That always and always under the sun
I went forth to battle and never won.
A slayer of men, I was doomed to abide,
For ever and aye, on the losing side.
Whenever. I dream of the wonderful goal,
I thank the hidden God in my soul
That though I have always been meanly born,
A tiller of earth and a reaper of corn,
Whenever through ages past and gone
The light divine for a moment shone,
Whenever piercing laborious night
A ray fell straight from the Light of Light,
Whenever amid fierce, lightning and storm
The divine moved in a human form,
Whenever the earth in her cyclic course
Shook at the touch of an unknown force,
Whenever the cloud of dull years grew thin
And a great star called to the light within,
I have braved storm and labour and sun
To stand at the side that Holy One.
No matter how humble my birth has been,
There are few who have seen what I have seen.
Mine the shepherd’s star and the reaper’s reward,
And the dream of him who fell by the sword.
One thing I have learned the long years through,
To know the false words from the true.
The slave who toiled on the banks of the Nile
With wisdom gladdened his long exile.
From Buddha at eve by the Ganges’ side
An outcast learnt the worth of the world’s pride.
To the tired reaper, when day was done,
Did Plotinus unveil the hidden sun.
Amongst the stars, on a Syrian night,
A ragged shepherd found the Light of Light.
From dream to dream, o’er valley and hill,
I followed the Lord Christ's wandering will.
Kings there are who would barter a throne
For the long day’s toil and the light unknown,
The deed of the strong and the word of the wise,
And the night under cold and starry skies—
The white light of dawn on the hillside shed
On Him who had nowhere to lay His head.
Behold there are kings who would change with me,
For the love of the ancient mystery.
Shepherd and reaper and slave I have been,
There are few who have seen what I have seen.
I have been a gipsy since those days,
And lived again in the wild wood ways.
Wise with the lore of those hidden things,
Learnt from Lord Christ in His wanderings,
Beggar and reaper and shepherd and slave,
I am one who rests not in any grave;
I will follow each stormy light divine,
And the secret of all things shall be mine.
These things have I seen, would you bid me mourn
That I was never an Emperor born?”

That I am this pre-autumn
Afternoon in the privacy

Grant myself permission
To believe in god once again
Is solely because I saw
An unexpected grasshopper
Staring at my thoughts
On the table that keeps
The telephone from having
A mind of its very own
At first I was startled
And then I was startled less
At the sight of this insect

In my High Rise Hobo apartment
Miracle on 53rd street
Grasshopper hopped all the way
39 floors above floor level
To deliberately invade my privacy
And I didn't mind at all
After grasshopper assured me
It didn't speak English or Spanish
Or Chinese with an Italian accent
So we hit it off right away
You mind your own business
And I will not ask you
Any personal questions aside
From how the hell did you get here
I've never written a poem
About grasshoppers this high up before
And I know it wasn't something
My non existing paint brushes
Conceived behind my back and
The only grass I have here is
To smoke & not hop around in
Until I get dizzy and levitate
There has to be a mistake
Or did the grasshopper take
The elevator to the 39th floor
And enter my apartment without knocking
To make it obvious grasshoppers
Have the right to remain silent also
And give credit to the desert
For his arrival and not no Almighty

Pilgrim feet, pray whither bound?  Pilgrim eyes, pray whither bent?  Sandal-shod and travel-gowned, Lo, I seek the way they went Late who passed toward Holy Land. Pilgrim, it was long ago; None remains who saw that band;  Grass and forest overgrow Every path their footing wore.  Men are wise; they seek no more  Roads that lead to Holy Land. Proud his look, as who should say:  I shall find where lies the way. Pilgrim, thou art fair of face,  Staff and scrip are not for thee; Gentle pilgrim, of thy grace, Leave thy quest, and bide with me.  Love shall serve thee, joy shall bless;  Thou wert made for tenderness:  God's green world is fair and sweet;  Not o'er sea and Eastern strand,  But where friend and lover meet  Lies the way to Holy Land. Low his voice, his lashes wet:  One day if God will—not yet. Pilgrim, pardon me and heed.  Men of old who took that way  Went for fame of goodly deed,  Or, if sooth the stories say,  Sandalled priest, or knight in selle,  Flying each in pain and hate,  Harassed by stout fiends of hell,  Sought his crime to expiate.  Prithee, Pilgrim, go not hence; Clear thy brow, and white thy hand,  What shouldst thou with penitence?  Wherefore seek to Holy Land? Stern the whisper on his lip:  Sin and shame are in my scrip. Pilgrim, pass, since it must be;  Take thy staff, and have thy will;  Prayer and love shall follow thee;  I will watch thee o'er the hill.  What thy fortune God doth know;  By what paths thy feet must go.  Far and dim the distance lies,  Yet my spirit prophesies: Not in vigil lone and late, Bowed upon the tropic sand,  But within the city gate, In the struggle of the street,  Suddenly thine eyes shall meet  His whose look is Holy Land. Smiled the pilgrim, sad and sage:  Long must be my pilgrimage.

    sound was like wind through the bones

         of their faces like a bright raft afloat in the dark;
       at times, rumors spread of his death, scholars
      analyzed his obsession, dated his bones, his prayer bundle;

in the blur of so many mornings, so many shoes
worn into scraps and discarded, so many

   rising from the dark waters of flood, outlined bright

       a genie, no magic wishes;
      not like the candles that hope sets aflame

no.
He carried it like

      so close the stars seemed to breathe in
   the branches, he would lie quiet,
then it would seem
that whatever it was in there
would pulse softly with light, a code
   only the heart could break
    (but of course he couldn’t say

    and at sunrise, wearily, he would rise
      to his feet and trudge on, sometimes
       running, sometimes stumbling,
         carrying whatever it was that could not
          be put down, would not be cast aside—
         and besides, he would chide himself,

                ","
The white train emerges from a dark curtain
of tall fir trees with its coat of light snow.
The white train appears as though newly escaped
from the jaws of night. The white train steams
out of the forest into the clear white
meadow, melting the fresh snow around it.
 
The trees are towering. Ancient giants.
A whole section seems to have been logged.
Over there the folded arms of soldiers who
gather in small groups. We cannot see
leaders or individual faces. Horsemen far away.
On their way to the revolution perhaps.
 
In the dining car, behind the velvet curtains—
blood puddings and sea pie, clear soups
and small marrow. Already today
the chef has cooked three luncheons
while crossing Poland; the starched
waiters managed without spilling a drop.
 
Dozens of dirty white napkins heap on hampers
like miniature Alps threatening to fall. But
now the train has braked and stopped. Small boys
fog the windows with their warm breath
as they watch the soldiers with silver sabers who
order everyone off the train, into the new snow.

                    Q’s Quest
                ","
Some quests begin before a person ever learns to walk. Q’s began at the foundling home, when he was still in diapers. They’d kept anything pointed from the Quonset hut where they housed the orphaned newbies, and later the house mothers forbade the children all but scissors with round edges, even table knives.
“Mind, now stay in the queue,” they said, when his fingers reached for a safety pin or a paring knife or, once, one of the razors they kept (usually under lock and key) for the older boys. Q slipped back in line.
Only the blunt was available to him, nothing to question, naught with an edge. Best pretend to be dull (though that was hard with a high IQ) and never query: Why hide the scissors? Why hide the razor? Why speak so sharply? Why no mums? No dads? At night in his bed, listening to the breathing of all the other boys in the long room, he also asked himself, Why me?

When the house mothers changed shifts, there were always some unsupervised minutes, and that’s when the boys sprang into swashbuckling. Q loved leaping from bed to bed with an imaginary sword in hand. En garde!

•
At sixteen, with a razor cut on his chin from the new trial of shaving himself, Q stood at the doors of the Royal Flower Hall. He was quaking. This was the very first day of work in his life. He’d been supposed to be a shop assistant, a quotidian job like those of the other orphans who were all sent out to live as apprentices — to return only if found unsuitable. However, the Royal Flower Keeper had stepped in and demanded to know the name of the boy meant to be sent to the local florist, and now young Q was called to prep flowers for the Queen.
“Can’t someone else do it?” he quailed as the Flower Keeper  handed him a quilloned silver thorn knife. Q didn’t want to be found unsuitable.
He quivered as thousands of roses arrived — he was supposed to separate their long, tangled stems, cut off the thorns, and queue them up straight on the tables for the arrangers.
“But I’m new!” Q cried. He couldn’t quell his horror at the prospect of lifting a real blade to cut the thorns.
“Look, dear, no quibbling. If you work here, you’re qualified,” the Flower Keeper said. Her knuckles bloomed out of the crooked stems of her hands. “Hold the knife with two fingers behind this little crossbar, that’s the quillon, and snip under the thorn.” She did it with elegant speed. One thorn gone.
“It’s like swordsmanship,” the Flower Keeper joked, wielding her knife, fencing in miniature mime. In Q’s head rang the orders of the house mothers, “don’t touch!” But in his fingers lay his imaginary weapon come alive.
“No time to be quiescent,” she said. “Equipoise is all.”

Don’t quit now, Q said to himself. If he quit, he’d have to slink back to the orphanage, a failed apprentice, instead of going home to his newly found haven, a cold-water flat with a coin-operated heater, all his own. There he’d store the new paring knife his paycheck would buy, the pointed scissors    ...    So Q quashed his fear and set to work.
•
He began to duel through the roses.
“En garde!” he whispered, lunging toward his petaled quarry.
Soon there were thorns everywhere (some a bit bloody), but he did not make any big mistakes. He wasn’t perfect, like the Flower Keeper, but he was catching on. Like quicksilver she flashed her knife, each stem quickening with the sharpest cut. Instinctively Q used the quartata maneuver, a quarter turn to the inside, protecting himself as he flicked each thorn into the quagmire of floral detritus on the floor. With each toss of the thorn he added to what appeared to the Flower Keeper to be his nascent gift.
As the lorries loaded with rose baskets and vases and bowls roared off to the palace, he quietly pocketed a thorn. Then the first question he’d ever spoken aloud curlicued to his lips. And because he’d had to save up this query for sixteen years, he posed the essential one, previously mouthed only to himself at night in bed:
Pourquoi?
“Why,” said the Flower Keeper, “for the Equerry, of course. And he for the Queen. You know who she is.”
“Just a flower of a figurehead,” Q quipped.

The boy’s quick-witted, the Flower Keeper thought, and said, “We’ll require you tomorrow.”
And for quadruple tomorrows after that and after that, until Q began to accumulate expertise. Know-how defines a person, especially someone who’s grown up watching his Ps and Qs. He no longer  quavered, quadrillions of roses now quasi-ordinary, royal waste a quiddity. 

I’m not a quitter, he’d said to himself, and each night went back to his cold-water flat where he had enshrined that little thorn in a matchbox.
•
Well, he didn’t live in a cold-water flat now. Now he lived in a sunlit house with a stash of razors in the marble bathroom and, in the drawers of his magnificent kitchen, a motherlode of paring knives, bread knives, steak knives, bird’s beak parers, boning knives, cheese knives, chef’s, clam, and carving knives, filleters, and mincers.
Now Q was Senior Keeper of the Royal Flower Hall, walking across a stage toward the Queen herself. He had kept the talisman thorn from his very first day with the roses. Just that afternoon he had taken it out and dropped it in the pocket of his tuxedo, anticipating touching it for luck before he received his award from Her Majesty.
But when the Queen posed her standard question, “Have you come a long way?” Q was quite bewildered as to how to answer.
Sometimes a simple question cuts into an aromatic world of mysteries. But we must learn to answer, to cut. Q, his distinguished silver hair perfectly trimmed, his neck properly shaved, looked down at the curls on the Queen’s forehead and remembered his first unspoken word, Why.
A quixotic word, an essential thorn. It had pricked him awake, into manhood.
Arrangements of roses passed through his mind — how those magnificats of magentas quenched his imagination. How the choral crooning of pale pinks calmed his qualms. Among roses he had reached his quintessence.
Yet, is it a large enough life, to arrange roses for a Queen? When the whole world out there hurtled toward famine and war? He hadn’t intended to stay, to make a future in flowers, taking people’s breath away with something so spectacularly unnecessary as his rose floats. He had been a thorn in someone’s side, spectacularly unnecessary himself. He’d been sent out into the world alone, blunted by the unknown facts of his identity — his search for his parents rewarded only by locked doors, locked cabinets, and, later, graveyards.
Patiently Her Majesty waited for his answer. In physical distance he had come a short way, but he’d swashbuckled miles to reach the end of his quest.
“Only from Kew Gardens, Your Highness,” Q answered simply at last.
Then she put into his palm the royal thank-you, in a quilted sleeve: a silver rose wreath made from an ancient mold that gave it stylized petals, prickly leaves, and, cut in at the bottom of the circle, a thorn.

regards the god in you

There were the generous days

behaving like perfect mortals,
which is to say imperfectly,

that let us gladly undress
our trepidations, and pleasure
our solitude into a blissful
oblivion; and the bad kind—
invisible woundings
no compliment or hot kiss,
no confession of the amorous
could soothe for long.
And then, when the mortals we were
had done enough to remind us
that to be mortal is to be susceptible
to the secret agenda, the cruel caprice,
the soft but eviscerating voice—
“at the mercy of a nuance”—
the god in you decided it was time
to act. A dark god, in need
of a human sacrifice, smoothly turning your back
on the earnest and their pathetic pleas.
So the god in me, no stranger to the aberrant
and the abhorrent, now has no choice
but to respond in kind. A pity, really,
since it has been the dream
of so many gods to find themselves

Halted against the shade of a last hill, They fed, and, lying easy, were at ease And, finding comfortable chests and knees Carelessly slept.                                 But many there stood still To face the stark, blank sky beyond the ridge, Knowing their feet had come to the end of the world. Marvelling they stood, and watched the long grass swirled By the May breeze, murmurous with wasp and midge, For though the summer oozed into their veins Like the injected drug for their bones’ pains, Sharp on their souls hung the imminent line of grass, Fearfully flashed the sky’s mysterious glass.   Hour after hour they ponder the warm field— And the far valley behind, where the buttercups Had blessed with gold their slow boots coming up, Where even the little brambles would not yield, But clutched and clung to them like sorrowing hands; They breathe like trees unstirred. Till like a cold gust thrilled the little word At which each body and its soul begird And tighten them for battle. No alarms Of bugles, no high flags, no clamorous haste— Only a lift and flare of eyes that faced The sun, like a friend with whom their love is done. O larger shone that smile against the sun,— Mightier than his whose bounty these have spurned.   So, soon they topped the hill, and raced together Over an open stretch of herb and heather Exposed. And instantly the whole sky burned With fury against them; and soft sudden cups Opened in thousands for their blood; and the green slopes Chasmed and steepened sheer to infinite space.   Of them who running on that last high place Leapt to swift unseen bullets, or went up On the hot blast and fury of hell’s upsurge, Or plunged and fell away past this world’s verge, Some say God caught them even before they fell. But what say such as from existence’ brink Ventured but drave too swift to sink. The few who rushed in the body to enter hell, And there out-fiending all its fiends and flames With superhuman inhumanities, Long-famous glories, immemorial shames— And crawling slowly back, have by degrees Regained cool peaceful air in wonder— Why speak they not of comrades that went under?

He drowsed and was aware of silence heaped  Round him, unshaken as the steadfast walls;  Aqueous like floating rays of amber light,  Soaring and quivering in the wings of sleep. Silence and safety; and his mortal shore  Lipped by the inward, moonless waves of death.    Someone was holding water to his mouth.  He swallowed, unresisting; moaned and dropped  Through crimson gloom to darkness; and forgot  The opiate throb and ache that was his wound.  Water—calm, sliding green above the weir;  Water—a sky-lit alley for his boat,  Bird-voiced, and bordered with reflected flowers  And shaken hues of summer: drifting down,  He dipped contented oars, and sighed, and slept.    Night, with a gust of wind, was in the ward,  Blowing the curtain to a gummering curve.  Night. He was blind; he could not see the stars  Glinting among the wraiths of wandering cloud;  Queer blots of colour, purple, scarlet, green,  Flickered and faded in his drowning eyes.    Rain—he could hear it rustling through the dark;  Fragrance and passionless music woven as one;  Warm rain on drooping roses; pattering showers  That soak the woods; not the harsh rain that sweeps  Behind the thunder, but a trickling peace,  Gently and slowly washing life away.  He stirred, shifting his body; then the pain  Leaped like a prowling beast, and gripped and tore  His groping dreams with grinding claws and fangs.  But someone was beside him; soon he lay  Shuddering because that evil thing had passed.  And death, who'd stepped toward him, paused and stared.    Light many lamps and gather round his bed.  Lend him your eyes, warm blood, and will to live.  Speak to him; rouse him; you may save him yet.  He's young; he hated war; how should he die  When cruel old campaigners win safe through?    But death replied: “I choose him.” So he went,  And there was silence in the summer night;  Silence and safety; and the veils of sleep.  Then, far away, the thudding of the guns.

I cut / / / / /
I multiply everyday images. I apply an aluminum point.
To the landscape.
To the sentence.
To the photo.
To the figure.
To the word.
And suddenly, with a slight tremor of eyes, vertebrae and fingers, I
destroy everything that exists.
Through the years, I’ve rebuilt the cells, uncovered the signs of the cold,
immaculate, academic vestibules and of the dead lips and histories in the
metropolitan streets.
My surgery is criminal.
No one has been able to identify the skeletons, the remains, the thousand
scattered nerves of personages I’ve gathered in order to bring this figure
back to life. The scars are numberless and invisible.
Who would suspect a grafik artist?
Who would suspect this gray table as a chamber of murders?
Instruments:
   —The pencil sleeping with its yellow blanket and rubber crown.
   —A magazine of memories, smiling women, men’s suits and watches like
      drops, like science.
   —Tubes of smothered ink sounding like small seas pounding a universe of   
      plastic.
   —A photo of a Chamula woman looking through these windows toward
      the Mission.
   —Watercolors: French Ultramarine, Emerald Green and Windsor Violet.
   —Matches thin friends identical soldiers with their red helmets thinking.
   —Dictionaries in Portuguese, Spanish and German, white pages beasts
      nobody hears moaning.
   —The priest lantern praying with its head pointing toward the floor in   
      front of a fierce wall.
   —Solemn archives organized by syllables, breaths, laughs and love with X.
   —A book about an artist: The Fabulous Life of Diego Rivera, printed in New
      York where they listen to the wind falling from the tallest building.

Every night cars cruise the streets of 24th and Mission. A woman from San   
José drives a blue Chevy with smoked windows. Estela. She has reddish   
hair. Tight brows and dark eyes desiring everything but this street that   
ends in eight blocks: Potrero Avenue. She’ll have to turn. But she won’t.   
She won’t go back to the home of twenty years and her father who pretends   
to play Santa by Agustín Lara on his old guitar and the mother organizing a   
Jehovah’s Witnesses’ meeting. Estela will leave the car parked between   
Harrison Street and Alabama in San Francisco. She’ll walk aimlessly in the   
warmth of the produce stores, into St. Peter’s church, by the Galería de la   
Raza, China Books, the bakery at La Victoria. She’ll walk in the night with   
her eyes burning, seeing him laughing, the young man in his black box   
apartment, laughing, laughing, laughing like a little man.
The little man laughs. It’s an apartment of marriage and fists. The   
wife-beater laughs in his easy chair. Next to his bed he sees the anxious   
note. He focuses on the signature with the E broken in three places.
He looks at the stained and unmade sheets, the dull curtains, the crushed   
cigarettes and the ashes. The black-and-white television announces a sale   
of living room furniture. With his can of beer he observes. Smokes. Thinks.
Within a week or two they’ll take his cousin to San Quentin prison, again.   
The last time he saw him he was a gardener at a college.
He imagines Estela coming home. He imagines and drinks calmly. Makes the   
bed. Turns off the television and turns on the fm. He amuses himself in   
that space or cube floating above the city.
Estela walks north on the Avenue.

Randi finds himself in a hospital in Los Angeles or maybe further south, in   
San Diego. I think his parents are from Arizona. He’s very ill. He’s in a room   
with a red sign hanging from the doorknob.
I / S / O / L / A / T / I / O / N
His liver is bloated, skin yellowed, hair long and greasy. Weakness   
consumes him night after night. He can’t speak, tires easily. But he can   
hear. He hears the white heels of the doctors and nurses running to the   
rooms of the dying. He hears footsteps fluttering like doves over the floor   
or like the leaves of fever falling from the roof of hell.
It’s eleven o’clock at night. He hears the abandoned man in room 200 fall   
out of bed attempting to drink a glass of water. He hears the IV tubes   
bursting, the sweet plasma spinning between the walls, the bag slipping to   
the floor and splattering through the night’s open screens.
The man screams. Vomits blood and ulcers. Gets tangled up in sheets and   
transparent plastic veins. After half an hour doves fly in. The leaves fall.   
Fast.
After a few days a black man enters room 199. An orderly. He cleans his   
body with a warm sponge. His hands run slowly down the yellowed back,   
the belly and fragile shoulders of Randi. Dark birds fly over a forgotten   
landscape. Randi looks at his mother rubbing his chest with alcohol to   
quiet the cough before he sleeps. He turns his face. Imagines his one-room   
house, a trailer his father made out of an old car. They’re on a little ranch   
at the outskirts of an unknown town. The mountains reflect the afternoon’s   
coppery heat. From afar you can see birds crossing above the saguaros and   
the sky.
The last time I saw Randi was at San Francisco City College. He had just   
turned in all his papers so he could drop out at midterm. He didn’t want to   
go on with it. It was a farce.
Like when he was invited to read poetry near the Galería de La Raza in the   
Mission District. He never showed up. Took 18th instead of 24th Street.   
Some Latinos beat him up. They noticed a homosexual air about him.

He says he’ll give you morphine for the stitches afterwards. Even if you   
scream, Eva, it’ll be alright. Even if the nurses ignore you, laugh at you as   
they see your bluish mouth open, your sleepwalker’s eyes, your hands   
scratching against the metal bed or the air or memories. For one long   
second they’ll study your womb in bandages stains clouds raindrops suns   
and rouge shadows and rage over the coffin hidden by 10 centimeters of

Someone has erased all the E’s from all the pages; small empty rectangles   
remain. The ink runs searching for asylum.

Diego, you touch up a colossal worker with too-sad eyes, wearing a faded   
blue cotton shirt. His eyes are swollen. The worker wants to see, but his   
eyes don’t count anymore, just his hands.
They fly.
They untangle above new machines toward the future. Touching the   
atmosphere. The fingers touch the 17th of February, 1981.
The National Guard enters the province of Las Cabañas in El Salvador. They   
trap the area, cutting off all the roads out for the campesinos. Bombs fall.   
The mountains explode rocks, roots and water. An iron shell splinter rips   
into the throats of grandfathers and little girls. The initials U S A sweat.
They sweat through the paint of the Guardia helicopters swooping down   
over the huts and fields of corn.
Seven thousand begin to run toward the Río Lempa. 15km and then the wide   
river. 15km and then maybe refuge in the jungles of Honduras. Only

13kms   lifts it up like a torch

They reach the river. They jump in the water. Suddenly, from the Honduran   
side other helicopters and machine guns appear. The wind surrenders. The   
afternoon weakens.
The giant worker’s machinery shrieks on the tiny corner of the page: Plate   
number 113. It’s your self-portrait that you painted on the wall of the   
San Francisco Art Institute.

a figure dealt out in different boxes toward different destinies. No one   
has been able to figure out what happened on this table. But it’s time to   
turn off the black lamp.

Your landscape sickens with a dry disease
Even in May, Virginia, and your sweet pines
Like Frenchmen runted in a hundred wars
Are of a child’s height in these battlefields.
For Wilson sowed his teeth where generals prayed
—High-sounding Lafayette and sick-eyed Lee—
The loud Elizabethan crashed your swamps
Like elephants and the subtle Indian fell.
Is it for love, you ancient-minded towns,
That on the tidy grass of your great graves
And on your roads and riverways serene
Between the corn with green flags in a row,
Wheat amorous as hair and hills like breasts
Each generation, ignorant of the last,
Mumbling in sheds, embarrassed to salute,
Comes back to choke on etiquette of hate?
You manufacture history like jute—
Labor is cheap, Virginia, for high deeds,
But in your British dream of reputation
The black man is your conscience and your cost.
Here on the plains perfect for civil war
The clapboard city like a weak mirage
Of order rises from the sand to house
These thousands and the paranoid Monroe;
The sunrise gun rasps in the throat of heaven;
The lungs of dawn are heavy and corrupt;
We hawk and spit; our flag walks through the air
Breathing hysteria thickly in each face.
Through the long school of day, absent in heart,
Distant in every thought but self we tread,
Wheeling in blocks like large expensive toys
That never understand except through fun.
To steal aside as aimlessly as curs
Is our desire; to stare at corporals
As sceptically as boys; not to believe
The misty-eyed letter and the cheap snapshot.
To cross the unnatural frontier of your name
Is our free dream, Virginia, and beyond,
White and unpatriotic in our beds,
To rise from sleep like driftwood out of surf.
But stricter than parole is this same wall
And these green clothes, a secret on the fields,
In towns betray us to the arresting touch
Of lady-wardens, good and evil wives.
And far and fabulous is the word “Outside”
Like “Europe” when the midnight liners sailed,
Leaving a wake of ermine on the tide
Where rubies drowned and eyes were softly drunk.
Still we abhor your news and every voice
Except the Personal Enemy’s, and songs
That pumped by the great central heart of love
On tides of energy at evening come.
Instinctively to break your compact law
Box within box, Virginia, and throw down
The dangerous bright habits of pure form
We struggle hideously and cry for fear.
And like a very tired whore who stands
Wrapped in the sensual crimson of her art
High in the tired doorway of a street
And beckons half-concealed the passerby,
The sun, Virginia, on your Western stairs
Pauses and smiles away between the trees,
Motioning the soldier overhill to town
To his determined hungry burst of joy.

I knew a man, he was my chum, but he grew blacker every day, and would not brush the flies away, nor blanch however fierce the hum of passing shells; I used to read, to rouse him, random things from Donne— like “Get with child a mandrake-root.” But you can tell he was far gone, for he lay gaping, mackerel-eyed, and stiff, and senseless as a post even when that old poet cried “I long to talk with some old lover’s ghost.”   I tried the Elegies one day, But he, because he heard me say: “What needst thou have no more covering than a man?” grinned nastily, and so I knew the worms had got his brains at last. There was one thing that I might do to starve the worms; I racked my head for healthy things and quoted Maud. His grin got worse and I could see he sneered at passion’s purity. He stank so badly, though we were great chums I had to leave him; then rats ate his thumbs.

In vain thou bid’st me strike the lyre,   And sing a song of mirth and glee,Or, kindling with poetic fire,   Attempt some higher minstrelsy;In vain, in vain! for every thought   That issues from this throbbing brain,Is from its first conception fraught   With gloom and darkness, woe and pain.From earliest youth my path has been   Cast in life’s darkest, deepest shade,Where no bright ray did intervene,    Nor e’er a passing sunbeam strayed;But all was dark and cheerless night,    Without one ray of hopeful light.From childhood, then, through many a shock,   I’ve battled with the ills of life,Till, like a rude and rugged rock,   My heart grew callous in the strife.When other children passed the hours   In mirth, and play, and childish glee,Or gathering the summer flowers   By gentle brook, or flowery lea,I sought the wild and rugged glen   Where Nature, in her sternest mood, Far from the busy haunts of men,   Frowned in the darksome solitude.There have I mused till gloomy night,   Like the death-angel’s brooding wing,Would shut out every thing from sight,   And o’er the scene her mantle fling;And seeking then my lonely bed   To pass the night in sweet repose,Around my fevered, burning head,   Dark visions of the night arose;And the stern scenes which day had viewed   In sterner aspect rose before me,And specters of still sterner mood   Waved their menacing fingers o’er me.When the dark storm-fiend soared abroad,   And swept to earth the waving grain,On whirlwind through the forest rode,   And stirred to foam the heaving main,I loved to mark the lightning’s flash,   And listen to the ocean’s roar,Or hear the pealing thunder’s crash,   And see the mountain torrents pourDown precipices dark and steep,   Still bearing, in their headlong courseTo meet th’ embrace of ocean deep,   Mementoes of the tempest’s force;For fire and tempest, flood and storm,   Wakened deep echoes in my soul,And made the quickening life-blood warm   With impulse that knew no control;And the fierce lightning’s lurid flash   Rending the somber clouds asunder,Followed by the terrific crash    Which marks the hoarsely rattling thunder, Seemed like the gleams of lurid light   Which flashed across my seething brain,Succeeded by a darker night,   With wilder horrors in its train.And I have stood on ocean’s shore,   And viewed its dreary waters roll, Till the dull music of its roar   Called forth responses in my soul;And I have felt that there was traced   An image of my inmost soul,In that dark, dreary, boundless waste,   Whose sluggish waters aimless roll—Save when aroused by storms’ wild force   It lifts on high its angry wave, And thousands driven from their course   Find in its depths a nameless grave.Whene’er I turned in gentler mood   To scan the old historic page,It was not where the wise and good,   The Bard, the Statesman, or the Sage, Had drawn in lines of living light, Lessons of virtue, truth and right;But that which told of secret league,   Where deep conspiracies were rife,And where, through foul and dark intrigue,   Were sowed the seeds of deadly strife.Where hostile armies met to seal   Their country’s doom, for woe or weal;Where the grim-visaged death-fiend drank   His full supply of human gore,And poured through every hostile rank   The tide of battle’s awful roar;For then my spirit seemed to soar   Away to where such scenes were rife,And high above the battle’s roar   Sit as spectator of the strife—And in those scenes of war and woe,A fierce and fitful pleasure know.There was a time when I possessed   High notions of Religion’s claim,Nor deemed its practice, at the best,   Was but a false and empty name;But when I saw the graceless deeds   Which marked its strongest votaries’ path,How senseless bigots, o’er their creeds,   Blazing with wild fanatic wrath,Let loose the deadly tide of war,Spread devastation near and far, Through scenes of rapine, blood and shame,Of cities sacked, and towns on flame,Caused unbelievers’ hearts to feelThe arguments of fire and steelBy which they sought t’ enforce the word,   And make rebellious hearts approveThose arguments of fire and sword   As mandates of the God of love—How could I think that such a faith,   Whose path was marked by fire and blood,That sowed the seeds of war and death,   Had issued from a holy God?There was a time when I did love,   Such love as those alone can know,Whose blood like burning lava moves,   Whose passions like the lightning glow;And when that ardent, truthful love,   Was blighted in its opening bloom,And all around, below, above,   Seemed like the darkness of the tomb,’Twas then my stern and callous heart,Riven in its most vital part,Seemed like some gnarled and knotted oak,That, shivered by the lightning’s stroke,Stands in the lonely wanderer’s path,A ghastly monument of wrath.Then how can I attune the lyre   To strains of love, or joyous glee?Break forth in patriotic fire,   Or soar on higher minstrelsy,To sing the praise of virtue bright,Condemn the wrong, and laud the right;When neither vice nor guilt can fling   A darker shadow o’er my breast,Not even Virtue’s self can bring,   Unto my moody spirit, rest.It may not be, it cannot be!   Let others strike the sounding string,And in rich strains of harmony,   Songs of poetic beauty sing;But mine must still the portion be,   However dark and drear the doom,To live estranged from sympathy,   Buried in doubt, despair and gloom;To bare my breast to every blow,To know no friend, and fear no foe,Each generous impulse trod to dust,Each noble aspiration crushed, Each feeling struck with withering blight,With no regard for wrong or right,No fear of hell, no hope of heaven, Die all unwept and unforgiven,Content to know and dare the worstWhich mankind’s hate, and heaven’s curse,Can heap upon my living head,Or cast around my memory dead;And let them on my tombstone trace,Here lies the Pariah of his race.

A march in the ranks hard-prest, and the road unknown,A route through a heavy wood with muffled steps in the darkness,Our army foil’d with loss severe, and the sullen remnant retreating,Till after midnight glimmer upon us the lights of a dim-lighted building,We come to an open space in the woods, and halt by the dim-lighted building,’Tis a large old church at the crossing roads, now an impromptu hospitalEntering but for a minute I see a sight beyond all the pictures and poems ever made,Shadows of deepest, deepest black, just lit by moving candles and lamps,And by one great pitchy torch stationary with wild red flame and clouds of smoke,By these, crowds, groups of forms vaguely I see on the floor, some in the pews laid down,At my feet more distinctly a soldier, a mere lad, in danger of bleeding to death, (he is shot in the abdomen,)I stanch the blood temporarily, (the youngster’s face is white as a lily,)Then before I depart I sweep my eyes o’er the scene fain to absorb it all,Faces, varieties, postures beyond description, most in obscurity, some of them dead,Surgeons operating, attendants holding lights, the smell of ether, the odor of blood,The crowd, O the crowd of the bloody forms, the yard outside also fill’d,Some on the bare ground, some on planks or stretchers, some in the death-spasm sweating,An occasional scream or cry, the doctor’s shouted orders or calls,The glisten of the little steel instruments catching the glint of the torches,These I resume as I chant, I see again the forms, I smell the odor,Then hear outside the orders given, Fall in, my men, fall in;But first I bend to the dying lad, his eyes open, a half-smile gives he me,Then the eyes close, calmly close, and I speed forth to the darkness,Resuming, marching, ever in darkness marching, on in the ranks,The unknown road still marching.

O living pictures of the dead, O songs without a sound, O fellowship whose phantom tread Hallows a phantom ground— How in a gleam have these revealed The faith we had not found.   We have sought God in a cloudy Heaven, We have passed by God on earth: His seven sins and his sorrows seven, His wayworn mood and mirth, Like a ragged cloak have hid from us The secret of his birth.   Brother of men, when now I see The lads go forth in line, Thou knowest my heart is hungry in me As for thy bread and wine; Thou knowest my heart is bowed in me To take their death for mine.

Your needle with your special shot   
To quiet you; you won’t get caught

I nursed you, fed you till you grew

This is the glass tube that contains
Calm that will spread down through your veins   
To free you finally from all pains

This tiny pinprick sets the germ
Inside you that fills out its term
Till you can feel yourself grow firm
    Against all doubt, all terror.
Into this spoon I break the pill   
That stiffens the unsteady will   
And hardens you against the chill
    Voice of a world of lies.
This amber medicine implants   
Steadfastness in your blood; this grants   
Immunity from greed and chance,
    And from all compromise.
This is the serum that can cure
Weak hearts; these pure, clear drops insure   
You’ll face what comes and can endure   
    The test; you’ll never falter.
This is the potion that preserves
You in a faith that never swerves;
This sets the pattern of your nerves
    Too firm for you to alter.
I set this spoon between your tight   
Teeth, as I gave you your first bite;   
This satisfies your appetite
    For other nourishment.
Take this on your tongue; this do   
Remembering your mother who
So loved her Leader she stayed true
    When all the others went,
When every friend proved false, in the   
Delirium of treachery
On every hand, when even He
    Had turned His face aside.
He shut himself in with His whore;
Then, though I screamed outside His door,   
Said He’d not see me anymore.
    They both took cyanide.
Open wide, now, little bird;
I who sang you your first word
Soothe away every sound you’ve heard   
    Except your Leader’s voice.
Close your eyes, now; take your death.   
Once we slapped you to take breath.   
Vengeance is mine, the Lord God saith
    And cancels each last choice.
Once, my first words marked out your mind;   
Just as our Leader’s phrases bind
All hearts to Him, building a blind
    Loyalty through the nation,
We shape you into a pure form.
Trapped, our best soldiers tricked the storm,   
The Reds: those last hours, they felt warm   
    Who stood fast to their station.
You needn’t fear what your life meant;
You won’t curse how your hours were spent;   
You’ll grow like your own monument
    To all things sure and good,
Fixed like a frieze in high relief
Of granite figures that our Chief
Accepts into His true belief,
    His true blood-brotherhood.
You’ll never bite the hand that fed you,   
Won’t turn away from those that bred you,   
Comforted your nights and led you
    Into the thought of virtue;
You won’t be turned from your own bed;   
Won’t turn into that thing you dread;   
No new betrayal lies ahead;
    Now no one else can hurt you.

At sixteen I was so vulnerable to every influence
That the overcast light, making the trash of addicts & sunbathers suddenly clearer
On the paths of the city park, seemed death itself spreading its shade   
Over the leaves, the swan boats, the gum wrappers, and the quarreling ducks.
It took nothing more than a few clouds straying over the sun,
And I would begin falling through myself like an anvil or a girl's comb or a feather
Dropped, tossed, or spiraling by pure chance down the silent air shaft of a warehouse,
The spiderweb in one fourth-floor window catching, in that moment, the sunset.
For in such a moment, to fall was to be simplified & pure,
With a neck snapped like a stem instead
Of whoever I turned out to be,
Wiping the window glass clear with one cuff
To gaze out at a two-hundred-year-old live oak tethering
The courtyard to its quiet,
The tree so old it has outlived even its life as a cliché,
And has survived, with no apparent effort, every boy who marched, like a wilderness
Himself, past it on his way to enlist in Lee’s army,
And now it swells gently in the mist & the early sunlight.
So who saved me? And for what purpose?
Beneath the small angel cut from cheap stone, there was nothing   
But my name & the years 1947-1949,
And the tense, muggy little quiet of a place where singing ends,
And where there is only the leftover colored chalk & the delusions of voodoo,
The small bones & X’s on stones signifying the practitioner’s absence,   
Entirely voluntary, from the gnat swirl & humming of time;
To which the chalked X on stone is the final theory; it is even illiterate.   
It is not even a lock of hair on a grave. It is not even
The small crowd of roughnecks at Poe’s funeral, nor the blind drunkard   
Laughing there, the white of his eyes the unfurling of a cold surf below a cliff—
Which is the blank wave sprawl of fact receding under the cries of gulls—
Which is not enough.*
I should rush out to my office & eat a small, freckled apple leftover   
From 1970 & entirely wizened & rotted by sunlight now,
Then lay my head on my desk & dream again of horses grazing, riderless & still saddled,
Under the smog of the freeway cloverleaf & within earshot of the music waltzing with itself out
Of the topless bars & laundromats of East L.A.
I should go back again & try to talk my friend out of his diet
Of methamphetamine & vodka yogurts & the look of resignation spreading over his face
Like the gray shade of a tree spreading over a sleeper in the park—
For it is all or nothing in this life, for there is no other.
And without beauty, Bakunin will go on making his forlorn & unreliable little bombs in the cold, & Oswald will adjust   
The lenses on the scope of his rifle, the one
Friend he has carried with him all the way out of his childhood,
The silent wood of its stock as musical to him in its grain as any violin.   
This must have been what they meant,
Lincoln & Whitman, joining hands one overcast spring afternoon   
To stroll together through the mud of Washington at the end   
Of the war, the tears welling up in both their eyes,
Neither one of them saying a word, their hands clasped tightly together   
As they walk for block after block past
The bay, sorrel, chestnut, and dapple-gray tail swish of horses,
And waiting carriages, & neither one of them noticing, as they stroll & weave,
The harness gall on the winters of a mare,
Nor the gnats swarming over it, alighting now on the first trickle of blood uncaking from the sore;
And the underfed rib cage showing through its coat each time it inhales   
Like the tines of a rake combing the battleground to overturn   
Something that might identify the dead at Antietam.
The rake keeps flashing in the late autumn light.
And Bakunin, with a face impassive as a barn owl’s & never straying from the one true text of flames?
And Lincoln, absentmindedly trying to brush away the wart on his cheek   
As he dresses for the last time,
As he fumbles for a pair of cuff links in a silk-lined box,
As he anticipates some pure & frivolous pleasure,
As he dreams for a moment, & is a woman for a moment,
And in his floating joy has no idea what is going to happen to him in the next hour?
And Oswald dozing over a pamphlet by Trotsky in the student union?   
Oh live oak, thoughtless beauty in a century of pulpy memoirs,   
Spreading into the early morning sunlight
As if it could never be otherwise, as if it were all a pure proclamation of leaves & a final quiet—*
But it’s all or nothing in this life; it’s smallpox, quicklime, & fire.
It’s the extinct whistling of an infantry; it is all the faded rosettes of blood
Turning into this amnesia of billboards & the ceaseless hunh? of traffic.   
It goes on & I go with it; it spreads into the sun & air & throws out a fast shade
That will never sleep, and I go with it; it breaks Lincoln & Poe into small drops of oil spreading
Into endless swirls on the water, & I recognize the pattern:*
There there now, Nothing.
Stop your sniveling. Stop sifting dirt through your fingers into your glass of milk,
A milk still white as stone; whiter even. Why don’t you finish it?
We’d better be getting on our way soon, sweet Nothing.
I’ll buy you something pretty from the store.
I’ll let you wear the flower in your hair even though you can only vanish entirely underneath its brown, implacable petals.
Stop your sniveling. I can almost see the all night diner looming   
Up ahead, with its lights & its flashing sign a testimony to failure.
I can almost see our little apartment under the freeway overpass, the cups on the mantle rattling continually—
The Mojave one way; the Pacific the other.
At least we’ll have each other’s company.
And it’s not as if you held your one wing, tattered as it was, in contempt   
For being only one. It’s not as if you were frivolous.
It’s not like that. It’s not like that at all.
Riding beside me, your seat belt around your invisible waist. Sweet Nothing.   
Sweet, sweet Nothing.

“I do not know English”
—from “I Do Not” by Michael Palmer

“Marunong akong mag-ingles” (I do know English)
—any 21st-century Filipino poet




I do know English.
I do know English for I have something to say about this latest peace stirring between a crack that’s split a sidewalk traversing a dusty border melting at noon beneath an impassive sun.
I do know English and, therefore, when hungry, can ask for more than minimum wage, pointing repeatedly at my mouth and yours.
Such a gesture can only mean what it means: I do not want to remain hungry and I am looking at your mouth.
I do know English and still will not ask permission.
I shall call you “Master” with a lack of irony; lift my cotton blouse; cup my breasts to offer them to your eyes, your lips, your tongue; keen at the moon hiding at 11 a.m. to surface left tendon on my neck. For your teeth. And so on.
No need to decipher your response—and if you wish, go ahead: spank me.
I do know English. Therefore I can explain this painting of a fractured grid as the persistent flux of our “selves” as time unfolds.
There is a way to speak of our past or hopes for the future, the hot-air balloon woven from a rainbow’s fragments now floating over St. Helena; your glasses I nearly broke when, afterwards, you flung me to the floor as violence is extreme and we demand the extreme from each other; your three moans in a San Francisco hallway after I fell to my knees; your silence in New York as I knocked on your door. There is a way to articulate your silence—a limousine running over a child on the streets of Manila and Shanghai. And Dubai.
There is a way to joke about full-haired actors running for President and the birth of a new American portrait: “Tight as a Florida election.”
I do know English and so cannot comprehend why you write me no letters even as you unfailingly read mine.
Those where I write of the existence of a parallel universe to create a haven when your silence persists in this world I was forced to inherit.
Which does not mean I cannot differentiate between a reflection and a shadow, a threnody and a hiccup, the untrimmed bougainvillea bush mimicking a fire and the lawn lit by a burning cross.
I can prove Love exists by measuring increased blood flow to the brain’s anterior cingulated cortex, the middle insula, the putamen and the caudate nucleus.
Nor is “putamen” a pasta unless I confirm to you that my weak eyesight misread “puttanesca” as the crimson moon began to rise, paling as it ascends for fate often exacts a price.
I can see an almond eye peer behind the fracture on a screen and know it is not you from the wafting scent of crushed encomiums.
I can remind you of the rose petals I mailed to you after releasing them from the padded cell between my thighs.
I slipped the petals inside a cream envelope embossed in gold with the seal of a midtown Manhattan hotel whose façade resembles a seven-layered wedding cake. Which we shall share only through the happiness of others. Which does not cancel Hope.
I can recite all of your poems as I memorized them through concept as well as sound.
I speak of a country disappearing and the impossibility of its replacement except within the tobacco-scented clench of your embrace.
I can tell you I am weary of games, though they continue. Manila’s streets are suffused with protesters clamoring for an adulterer’s impeachment. Their t-shirts are white to symbolize their demand for “purity.” Space contains all forms, which means it lack geometry. My lucid tongue has tasted the dust from monuments crumbling simply because seasons change.
Because I do know English, I have been variously called Miss Slanted Vagina, The Mail Order Bride, The One With The Shoe Fetish, The Squat Brunette Who Wears A Plaid Blazer Over A Polka-Dot Blouse, The Maid.
When I hear someone declare war while observing a yacht race in San Diego, I understand how “currency” becomes “debased.”
They have named it The Tension Between The Popular Vote And The Electoral College.

Where there’s blood, there are birds.
After the war, many of the men’s faces are missing parts: an eye, a nose, a mouth.
One doctor uses a man’s own rib to construct a new jaw.
They call him the-man-who-fixes-faces.
A body might stay whole in the trench, but who can resist looking up, sometimes, at the birds?
You get out alive, maybe, but your face wears forever the look of what’s lost.
The-man-who-fixes-faces might give you something like a face.
Now all you see are faces turning away.
A bullet wounds in a straight line, but shrapnel is feathery: it picks up dirt.
The birds, it’s easy to forget, are filthy; a little bird in the blood can kill you.
A square within a circle, the golden ratio, symmetry, they say, makes a face beautiful.
Birds have two eyes, two legs, and two wings, but the soldier’s face is half here, half in the air.
Mirrors can be psychologically damaging to birds.
Birds are territorial.
Birds keep going back to the fountain to check on that one bird beneath the water.
In the park near the hospital, the-man-who-fixes-faces paints some of the benches blue.
The blue benches are for the men whose faces are unrecognizable.
I’ve seen a bird attack a window.
If you don’t want to see a man healing, look up at the sky.
Why is the sky blue?
Symmetry: a line drawn from the sun through the zenith to the “anti-sun.”

You slow down to watch cumulus clouds stream across the
sky. You choose a more circuitous route home and pass a
tree with white bags tied around random apples. The apples
remind you of clouds, how each hangs in the sky, singular
yet part of a flock. Each item in the flock is a coordinate of
earth and sky, enumerating space. The flocks of apples and
clouds are actual infinities, an endless collection of discrete
items that one can conceivably count to the end. This is
different from potential infinity, which is the entirety of
infinity, an immeasurable continuum that is greater than the
sum of its parts. After your first glimpse, you are lonely for
more contraction of space around the light of your mind
contemplating what cannot be conceived. What cannot be
conceived this morning? The Army has found the larynx of
an Iraqi man that American soldiers slowly strangled to
death. His ribs, additional evidence for the trial, are still
missing. They are in a refrigerator in Washington, D.C.
These are discrete items; whereas how the passage of time
felt as the soldiers strangled him is a continuum of infinite
pain. And his words and songs and prayers and curses he
will never speak are an empty set.

They watched them stand in the field and chew. “Which one,” asked Walter B., “do you think is the hero?” “That one,” said Beatrice. “Definitely that one. The one with the mittens.” “Yes,” agreed Walter B., “the others seem less... festooned.” “And which one do you think,” asked Walter B., “is the traitor?” Beatrice bit her lip and looked around. “Maybe that one,” she said. “The one with the orange flower in the pocket of his vest.” Walter B. agreed, but to be certain he thought that he should ask. “Little traitor,” called out Walter B. The traitor looked up. “I knew it!” said Beatrice, clapping her hands. The traitor came closer. The wind shook the orange flower loose from his pocket, but he did not run after it. He missed his mother. The traitor came closer, but then he stopped. He curled into his flowerless vest and fell asleep. Walter B. and Beatrice yawned. The soldiers dressed like children opened their mouths as wide as they could, but there was no more candy. There would never again be more candy. And so they sailed away to another land.

Soldiers are dreamers; when the guns begin
They think of firelit homes, clean beds and wives.
I see them in foul dug-outs, gnawed by rats,
And in the ruined trenches, lashed with rain,   
Dreaming of things they did with balls and bats,
And mocked by hopeless longing to regain   
Bank-holidays, and picture shows, and spats,
And going to the office in the train.

The sun rose over the sweep of the hill    All bare for the gathered hay, And a blackbird sang by the window-sill,    And a girl knelt down to pray:          ‘Whom Thou hast kept through the night, O Lord,          Keep Thou safe through the day.’   The sun rose over the shell-swept height,     The guns are over the way, And a soldier turned from the toil of the night    To the toil of another day,          And a bullet sang by the parapet          To drive in the new-turned clay.   The sun sank slow by the sweep of the hill,     They had carried all the hay, And a blackbird sang by the window-sill,    And a girl knelt down to pray:          ‘Keep Thou safe through the night, O Lord,          Whom Thou hast kept through the day.’   The sun sank slow by the shell-swept height,    The guns had prepared a way, And a soldier turned to sleep that night    Who would not wake for the day,          And a blackbird flew from the window-sill,          When a girl knelt down to pray.

All the hills and vales along Earth is bursting into song, And the singers are the chaps Who are going to die perhaps. O sing, marching men, Till the valleys ring again. Give your gladness to earth’s keeping, So be glad, when you are sleeping.   Cast away regret and rue, Think what you are marching to. Little live, great pass. Jesus Christ and Barabbas Were found the same day. This died, that went his way. So sing with joyful breath, For why, you are going to death. Teeming earth will surely store All the gladness that you pour.   Earth that never doubts nor fears, Earth that knows of death, not tears, Earth that bore with joyful ease Hemlock for Socrates, Earth that blossomed and was glad ‘Neath the cross that Christ had, Shall rejoice and blossom too When the bullet reaches you. Wherefore, men marching On the road to death, sing! Pour your gladness on earth’s head, So be merry, so be dead.   From the hills and valleys earth Shouts back the sound of mirth, Tramp of feet and lilt of song Ringing all the road along. All the music of their going, Ringing swinging glad song-throwing, Earth will echo still, when foot Lies numb and voice mute. On, marching men, on To the gates of death with song. Sow your gladness for earth’s reaping, So you may be glad, though sleeping. Strew your gladness on earth’s bed, So be merry, so be dead.

Fucked art thou, with luck, o reader within the palace within the palette within the impatience within, who tilts his letters into the light of the mind’s muttering unto itself, releasing their sounds to the whirlpool fierce of an ear to draw creations in—
Who brings forth a kiss of circumference, the glyphs hooked and loosened and linking, as though they were dancing through moths of minutes and months like wind—out of a god whose name is Gone ...
Fukkit and lukky art thou in the wind moving marjoram into the mint, the fuzz and down of the former grazing the raised ribs of the other, the essences borne—
Pheromones suddenly wafting, your eye catching the gradient greens and vein-like patterns, the gray stubble of sage’s tongue, thick oregano’s glister and whorl, stalks of thyme spiking the air on a kitchen porch or Sikinos slope with its lavender flower, lit up, still, in June;
The blue film of night’s end rolling into white near dawn, the light by which you know a friend, the ancients explain, from six feet off—or, a wolf from a dog;
The glow of morning bougainvillea, its papery bracts in a breeze like prayer, its bezeled ruby beginnings morphing into pinks- and magentas-to-come, cream-tipped corollas on perfect display, style and stigma sheathing the anther;
Then creeping Christians’ dusky luster, in the shade at noon;
Almonds swelling jade drupes into the sinking summer, encoding spring’s initial explosion;
Pomegranate’s garnet, pendant, containing—against the green of its arch and stretch—six hundred seeds dark with light, glinting in its skin;
Fucked, art thou, and lucky, who translates it into the day as blessed—
So blessèd as in blasted art thou, in a way, in whom this knowing is strengthened in bringing you down to the cords of arthritic knees,  wrestling the gust of a given moment’s giving—like vapor—and  strangely grateful;
Blessèd art thou whose petitions are curses, whose fuck touches the  innermost chamber, waking the king and queen in their slumber;
Blessèd the consonants funneling vowels,
In Scripture’s offering—a dove’s neck wrung, cakes unleavened and  mingled with oil;
Blessèd the spirit’s meniscus within a letter typed or scrawled, as  not-quite-deciphered codes of soul—
A pupil’s reaching through a sentence, slipping and reaching again, and again, a teacher tracing the shape of her thinking;
Blessèd even the stink and politic rot of the day’s pronouncements on high, Liver of the blaspheming Jew, gall of goat, and slips of yew—
in action as Evil: the concrete Lego-like bunker and tower, bunker and tower, barbwired cabbage and vines, shadows gliding as crows fly across the road to the holy of hills and prefab huts, from which goat-like thugs emerge, watching and then descending through a glowering slope- stepping prance, tribal fringes trailing—their dance sick with a stiffened faith, wicking and blotching their map of state, like a cancered scan,  eating away at its language and letters, as Gone yields goon, or gun, or bone, where lips meet and part in the “b” of all that’s brutal and also insidious, pointed to and taken on, in the maybe pointless battle—
Evoking the hundred blessings the rabbis say need to be uttered daily, reading the number—me’ah (hundred)—into the word for what, or mah: “What does Becoming your God ask of you?” (Deuteronomy, 10:12);
And blessèd is never quite knowing, exactly, what those blessings should be.

They too know all too well that some cracks were built just for us to fall through.  We live in a world that tries to steal spirits each day; they steal ours by taking us away.
From Industrial Schools to forced assimilation, genocide means removal  of those who birth nations — our living threatens. Colonization has been choking
us for generations. I tell my girls they are vessels of spirit, air to lungs expanding; this world cannot breathe without us. There are days  I wish
I didn’t have to teach these lessons, but as an Indigenous womxn  silence is deadening. There is danger in being seen, our bodies are targets
marked for violence. We carry the Earth’s me too inside us,  a howling wind, our mothers & their mothers swallowed these bullets long ago.
The voices ricochet I wish I were invisible I wish I were invisible  I wish echoes  in my eardrums — we know what it’s like to live in fear. Colonialism’s bullet sits cocked,
waiting behind a finger on trigger. We breathe and speak and sing  for survival. We carve out in lines; we write — I know joy I know pain I know loveI know love I know — lessons we’ve carried throughout time. Should I go missing: don’t stop searching; drag every river until it turns red and the waters of our names
stretch a flood so wide it catches everything. And we find each other whole and sacred, alive and breathing and breathing and breathing.

VThere, holding still, in frozen steadfastness,Their bayonets toward the beckoning frontiers,They lie—our comrades—lie among their peers,Clad in the glory of fallen warriors,Grim clustered under thorny trellises,Dry, furthest foam upon disastrous shores,Leaves that made last year beautiful, still strewnEven as they fell, unchanged, beneath the changing moon;And earth in her divine indifferenceRolls on, and many paltry things and meanPrate to be heard and caper to be seen.But they are silent, clam; their eloquenceIs that incomparable attitude;No human presences their witness are,But summer clouds and sunset crimson-hued,And showers and night winds and the northern starNay, even our salutations seem profane,Opposed to their Elysian quietude;Our salutations calling from afar,From our ignobler planeAnd undistinction of our lesser parts:Hail, brothers, and farewell; you are twice blest, brave hearts.Double your glory is who perished thus,For you have died for France and vindicated us.

                    Study of Two Figures (Pasiphaë/Sado)
                ","
One figure is female, the other is male.
Both are contained.
One figure is mythical, the other historical.
To the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, they occupy different millennia, different continents.
But, to the extent that one can be said to have existed at all, both figures are considered Asian—one from Colchis, one from Korea.
To mention the Asianness of the figures creates a “racial marker” in the poem.
This means that the poem can no longer pass as a white poem, that different people can be expected to read the poem, that they can be expected to read the poem in different ways.
To mention the Asianness of the figures is also to mention, by implication, the Asianness of the poet.
Revealing a racial marker in a poem is like revealing a gun in a story or like revealing a nipple in a dance.
After such a revelation, the poem is about race, the story is about the gun, the dance is about the body of the dancer—it is no longer considered a dance at all and is subject to regulation.
Topics that have this gravitational quality of aboutness are known as “hot button” topics, such as race, violence, or sex.
“Hot button” is a marketing term, coined by Walter Kiechel III, in a September 1978 issue of Fortune magazine.
The term evokes laboratory animals and refers to consumer desires that need to be slaked.
The term “hot button” suggests not only the slaking of such desires but also a shock or punishment for having acted on those desires, a deterrent to further actions pursuing such desires, and by extension, a deterrent to desire itself.
Violence and sex are examples of desires and can be satisfied, punished, and deterred.
Race is not usually considered an example of desire.
Both the female and the male figures are able to articulate their desires with an unusual degree of candor and specificity.
Both are responsible for many sexual deaths.
The male figure says, “When anger grips me, I cannot contain myself. Only after I kill something—a person, perhaps an animal, even a chicken—can I calm down.... I am sad that Your Majesty does not love me and terrified when you criticize me. All this turns to anger.” “Your Majesty,” here, refers to the king, his father.
The female figure is never directly quoted, but Pseudo-Apollodorus writes that she casts a spell upon the king her husband so that when he has sex with another woman, he ejaculates wild creatures into the woman’s vagina, thereby killing her. Although the punishment is enacted on the body of the woman, this punishment is meant to deter the king from slaking his desires.
Both figures, royal themselves, are angry at the king, but neither attempts to kill the king—which would be political. Instead they displace this anger onto other unnamed deaths, which are considered sexual but not political.
Both figures have spouses known for strategy, for self-preservation in  politically tumultuous times, times of many unnamed deaths.
Both figures are counterfoils to their strategizing spouses, figures of excessive  desire, requiring containment.
Both containers are wooden.
Both containers are camouflaged with a soft, yielding substance—one with grass, one with fur.
Both containers are ingenious solutions to seemingly intractable problems.
One problem is political. One problem is sexual.
They are both the same problem.
They have the same solution.
The male figure waits in the container for death to come. He waits for eight days. His son will live. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
The female figure waits in the container for the generation of a life. We do not know how long she waits. Her son will die, after waiting in his own wooden container. This ensures the succession, the frictionless transfer of power.
There are many artistic representations of both containers.
The male figure’s container is blockish, unadorned, a household object of standard size and quotidian function. Tourists climb into it and pose for photos, post them online. The cramped position of their bodies generates a combination of horror and glee. This, in turn, creates discomfort, the recognition that horror and glee should not be combined, that such a combination is taboo.
The female figure’s container is customized, lushly contoured. Its contours are excessively articulated to the same degree that her desire is excessively articulated. Artists depict the container in cutaway view, revealing the female figure within, awaiting the wild creature. The abject position of the female figure—on all fours, pressing her genitalia back against the hollow cow’s genitalia—generates a combination of lust and revenge. This, in turn, creates discomfort—the recognition that lust and revenge should not be combined, that wild creatures and female figures should not be combined, that these combinations are taboo.
Hot button topics are taboo because they generate discomfort.
The male figure slakes his violent desires and is punished. The male figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the violent desires of tourists  are slaked, while generating discomfort in these tourists.
The female figure slakes her sexual desires and is punished. The female  figure also functions as a hot button, a means whereby the sexual desires of artists are slaked, while generating discomfort in these artists.
The tourist can climb into the rice chest. The tourist can pose for a photo in the rice chest. Then the tourist can climb out of the rice chest and walk away.
The artist can look into the hollow cow. The artist can render the contours of the hollow cow, the contours of the female figure. Then the artist can walk away.
Both containers allow the tourist and artist to touch the hot button, the taboo.
The desire and the discomfort remain contained.
Both containers allow the tourist and the artist to walk away.
The male and female figures remain contained.
Neither container—the rice chest, the hollow cow—appears to have any necessary connection to race.
To mention race where it is not necessary to mention race is taboo.
I have not mentioned the race of the tourist or the artist.
The tourist and the artist are allowed to pass for white.
The tourist and the artist are not contained.
I have already mentioned the race of the poet.
But to the extent that the poet is not contained, the poet is allowed to pass for white.
I have already mentioned the race of the male and female figures.
The male and female figures are contained.
The rice chest and the hollow cow are containers.
The rice chest and the hollow cow are not the only containers in this poem.
Colchis and Korea are containers in this poem.
Asianness is a container in this poem.
Race is a container in this poem.
Each of these containers contains desire and its satisfaction.
Each of these containers contains discomfort and deterrence.
Each of these containers contains a hot button, a taboo.
The tourist and the artist can enter each of these containers.
The tourist and the artist can touch the hot button and walk away.
Each of these containers separates the slaking of desire from the punishment of desire.
Each of these containers is an ingenious solution to a seemingly intractable problem.
They are the same problem.
They have the same solution.
Each of these containers ensures the frictionless transfer of power.
Each of these containers holds a male or female figure.
The name of the male figure can be translated as “Think of me in sadness.”
The name of the female figure can be translated as “I shine for all of you.”

Blind voice, you who grope in the darkness of memory
for footsteps and gestures — I wouldn’t dare say kisses —

Breasts girded high, the sun in her hair, and that stature

Great suffering had desolated Greece.
So many bodies thrown

There’s something in me that likes
to imagine the things I’m afraid of,
for example, the future.
I don’t mean the celestial fireworks
from melting reactors, or New York
under six feet of sea water,
but the future in its most intimate,
most probable forms—vignettes
subversive enough to slip through the radar.
That’s how I come to be crouched
behind a stripped car wondering
would it be too dangerous
to piss in the street?
It would, I’m a woman.
So I go on holding it,
distracting myself by trying to remember
every fruit I’ve ever eaten,
their exact textures and flavors.
So far the most exotic is the custard apple.
I use up a whole hour of daylight
and then another—apricot, blueberry, plum—
calves cramping from having to stay low,
waiting behind a car pitted
with the acne of automatic fire.
There are still too many guns
walking around out there,
and no one I know,
so I’m waiting for twilight at least.
Is everyone alone now?
The wind says so. It says
a winter is coming without oil.
It bites to get my attention
and scatters a few leaflets,
pictures of a blackened car,
a city that seems to catch on fire
every sunset, though there’s
little enough to burn. Stone only chars.
This isn’t a likeness of the future, is it?
Every person in the street a stranger?
Will a word like ‘neighbor’ survive this?
I fired a gun once. It smelled rancid, sour,
like bad food. It hurt my shoulder
and left a wound of oil on my shirt.
My mind is thinking of sleep again.
Sleep lets things escape—my pocket-knife
vanished through a knife-sized hole.
There’s nothing to cut,
no guava, nectarine, winter pear,
and nothing left of the car at all,
not even the rear-view mirror
I was counting on,
hoping my face could tell me
it was safe to go home, and where is that?
A place with a bed
and a desk where I sit and plot
next year’s garden on graph paper.
The skin of a tangelo is faintly pebbly,
easy to peel, but the sweetest citrus
is the satsuma, then the clementine.
If I had to choose between natural
disaster and a firing squad,
I’d take the river of lava any day.
Hurricane, tidal wave, tornado, drought.
I want the earth, which is waiting
under the sidewalk, to be the one.
Not any of these human shadows
sporting their silhouetted guns.
There were gun shadows before,
but the two worlds overlapped,
guns and the amber waves of grain.
It’s hard to say whether bramble fruits
actually have skins. Does a raspberry?
Does each tiny globe have its own?
How will I live without the earth?
In a stripped car, unable to piss
when I want to, all the time cold?
Maybe weapons interbred with humans,
and a strain of hybrids was born,
half metal, half flesh.
I know there’s an enemy—
look at all the damage it’s doing.
Maybe it’s still a baby,
its weak neck wobbling as its carriage
lurches over the broken pavement.
But probably by now
it’s a sulking adolescent
starting to look like serious trouble,
with a silky little shadow-moustache
and a gun. Who’ll kill it? Will I?
What if it doesn’t look like the enemy?
What if it comes disguised as a savior,
or resembles nothing so much as hunger,
so that everyone has his own

Now in the shallowof a cave near the Khyber Pass, a stack of glow sticksactivated in the blast steeps the darkness green:two cans of pineapple; a mangled can of beetsbleeding juice; some boy streaked black, his burnswrapped in torn canvas tent ­flaps.

Only teaching on Tuesdays, book-worming
in pajamas fresh from the washer each morning,
I hog a whole house on Boston’s
“hardly passionate Marlborough Street,”
where even the man
scavenging filth in the back alley trash cans,
has two children, a beach wagon, a helpmate,
and is a “young Republican.”
I have a nine months’ daughter,
young enough to be my granddaughter.
Like the sun she rises in her flame-flamingo infants’ wear.
These are the tranquillized Fifties, 
and I am forty. Ought I to regret my seedtime?   
I was a fire-breathing Catholic C.O.,
and made my manic statement,
telling off the state and president, and then   
sat waiting sentence in the bull pen
beside a Negro boy with curlicues
of marijuana in his hair.
Given a year,
I walked on the roof of the West Street Jail, a short   
enclosure like my school soccer court,   
and saw the Hudson River once a day   
through sooty clothesline entanglements   
and bleaching khaki tenements.
Strolling, I yammered metaphysics with Abramowitz,
a jaundice-yellow (“it’s really tan”)

so vegetarian,
he wore rope shoes and preferred fallen fruit.   
He tried to convert Bioff and Brown,
the Hollywood pimps, to his diet.
Hairy, muscular, suburban,
wearing chocolate double-breasted suits,
they blew their tops and beat him black and blue.
I was so out of things, I’d never heard
of the Jehovah’s Witnesses.
“Are you a C.O.?” I asked a fellow jailbird.   
“No,” he answered, “I’m a J.W.”
He taught me the “hospital tuck,”
and pointed out the T-shirted back
of Murder Incorporated’s Czar Lepke,   
there piling towels on a rack,
or dawdling off to his little segregated cell full   
of things forbidden the common man:
a portable radio, a dresser, two toy American   
flags tied together with a ribbon of Easter palm.   
Flabby, bald, lobotomized,
he drifted in a sheepish calm,
where no agonizing reappraisal
jarred his concentration on the electric chair—
hanging like an oasis in his air
of lost connections....

It felt odd from the start, this war.
At the start, the 'death' of Saddam
when Baghdad was bombed, but
               he's not dead, a bizarre
                          Zapata,
and then the Scuds fired at  Kuwait
               but they weren't Scuds,
the 'chemical weapons of mass destruction
factory',  with earth banks and barbed wire
                  which wasn't one, however,
and the 'column of tanks destroyed leaving Basra'
                    which was three tanks,
the endless 'securing' of towns and cities
                      which aren't secure
even allowing for the distinction
that 'secure' does not mean 'safe',
the 'Uprising' in Basra
which no one could find there...
                                  Once
 there were poems in inverted commas, this
is a war of inverted commas. Once 
I wrote that 'poems about poems 
don't seem as abstract as they once did'
(although you don't need quotes, quoting 
yourself) and the Oxford Companion decided 
this meant I was no longer being abstract,  when
in fact I meant that poems about poems
(in that case partly a child) 
are not abstract because the abstract 
in them works through to a deeper real. Will
this war work through to the deeper real 
at last? Now it seems again, however,
that it feels odd, this war. I have paid it 
careful attention for almost a fortnight and what 
I would note here is that singular oddness
of feeling it evokes: one is alwaysat a tangent to it somehow, albeitwith despair's edgy wit. The deathshave black solidity, as if from method, nowhite napalm suddenness...I thought: is itfarce encoring tragedy, but thereis too much earnest passion in the evil,and one watches that eros like watchingspiders breed: 'It is what they do on this planet,'as a child's science fiction exercisemight observe. Spiders feed in street windowsbroken by children's bones flying, butthe US polls say yes: who want this so much.Who know what they do and also thatthey want those inverted commas, George-Bush-as-by-George-Orwell.            Is the USneed for war not 'a way to teach Americansgeography' as Bierce is often quoted, buta greed for abstractions: for the abstract, rather,not met by food or sex or fashion, byany intimate geography but this? But thenthe abstract is not the inverted commas,either, and it is those they want: the quoteswhich in two days will expire,                                the world left gasping with winded logic, the new skulls on dresses in the marketplace, damp empty dusty shoes. Günter Grass called this a 'wanted war' and perhaps that desire accounts for the oddncss of feeling: the animal impossibility of communication. In a damp concrete corner in the market, one's self-sense crouches close, alert for friendly fire.

into Berlin in boxes marked “Officers Only”

So it did not come as a surprise—a relief, almost—when we heard the tac-tac-tac of machine guns and the thud of grenades rising up from the woods below. The Germans were advancing again through the tangle of bomb-shattered branches, clearing a path with axe-blows, foreheads crushed beneath the overhang of great steel helmets, gleaming eyes fixed dead ahead.
     The rest of that day was bitter, and many of us fell forever headlong in the grass. But toward evening the voice of battle began to diminish, and then from the depths of the forest we could hear the song of the wounded: the serene, monotonous, sad-hopeful song of the wounded, joining the chorus of birds hidden in the foliage as they welcomed the return of the moon.
     It was still daylight, but the moon was rising sweetly from behind the forested mountains of Reims.
 It was green against a white and tender sky… 
           
            A moon from the forest of Ardennes,
            a moon from the country of Rimbaud, of Verlaine,
            a delicate green moon, round and light,
            entering the room of the sky from behind a screen of branches
            as if stepping delicately out of the earth,
            rising up from the grass, causing the tree-branches to blush
            transparent and sweet.
 
            Like startled birds, we had settled again around Jaco:
            I can't stand it any more, he smiled.
            Don't let me suffer.
            But now his smile was tired:
            a tired smile
            in a face clenched like a fist.
 
            Jaco's suffering gnawed away at us,
            sinking into our bones.
            There is nothing so terrible, or so sweet,
            so touching, as that animal, man,
            when he gives over to death.
            I felt my shirt sticking to my back. My face
            and the faces of the others were beaded with sweat,
            like the sweet face of Nazzareno Jacoboni.
            And little by little I became aware
            that everyone had slowly turned toward me,
            pinning me down with their eyes.
 
            Along with Jaco's terrible, unbearable suffering,
            something else was sinking into us, little by little,
            something which was not ours.
            Something strong, strange, insistent,
            was slowly being born within us.
            Jaco stared at me,
            even he now stared at me,
            expecting something,
            and I felt a new idea forming inside me,
            and inside the others.
           
            I can't go on, said Jaco.
            I looked away to the green moon hanging behind the trees:
            It had taken on the round shapeliness
            of a fragrant leaf: a laurel leaf,
            perhaps, or sage, or mint,
            a great green leaf, transparent with evening daylight.
            The sun had not yet settled into the forest,
            and his last warm rays struck the trunks of the trees
            leaving some of them wounded, bleeding.
            Others—the oaks, the beeches, poplars and birches—
            reflected the light in a strange way,
            as if they were made of glass.
 
            That glassy light, which the sun, just before it sets,
            draws from the earth's waters,
            drinks from its grass, from its leaves,
            from the trunks of its trees,
            to slake its thirst.
 
            All of them stared at me,
            but I was not aware of what I was doing.
            I felt my hands moving,
            but I did not know what I was doing until
            I found myself standing
            and saw them looking up at me,
            and Jacoboni smiling at me strangely,
            and felt something cold and smooth in my hands.
 
            And finally I was aware that I was standing
            with a rifle in my hands.
            I closed my eyes, and fired.
            I fired with my eyes closed,
            one shot after another.
           
            And then, when the echo of the shots
            had melted into the woods,
            there was a great silence.
 
            With my eyes still closed,
            rifle still in hand,
            I turned and took a few steps.
            Suddenly I heard: Murderer! Murderer!
             It was the voice of woman, terrible,
            the voice of a sister, desperate,
            the voice of a mother, of a lover.
            And at that moment nothing could have been more terrible
            than that voice of a woman,
            that voice of a mother, of a sister,
            of a lover, crying:
 
            Murderer!
      I opened my eyes and saw one of the girls running toward me, her hands like claws, as if she intended to tear me apart. She screamed again: Murderer! and then stopped abruptly a few paces away, filthy, disheveled, with a great bewilderment, spreading across her face, a wondrous pity. I stood in front of her, rifle in my hands, tears in my eyes.
     And they were certainly a marvelous thing, those tears, not only for her, but for me as well.
 My mother . . . 
             My mother was lying on her back,            her eyes were closed, and she seemed to be asleep;            Even her hand, abandoned on the sheets,            had dozed off.            I fell silent,            looking at the moon rising inch by inch
            over the olive trees of Settignano.
            It gave me great solace,            that moon and those trees.            That bright silver moon over silvery trees,            that moon in the shape of an olive leaf,            clean and transparent,            shining like a vein of silver, pulsing            through green marble            in the incensed darkness of a church.

Fair was the morning, fair our tempers, and We had seen nothing fairer than that land, Though strange, and the untrodden snow that made Wild of the tame, casting out all that was Not wild and rustic and old; and we were glad.   Fair, too, was afternoon, and first to pass Were we that league of snow, next the north wind.   There was nothing to return for, except need, And yet we sang nor ever stopped for speed, As we did often with the start behind. Faster still strode we when we came in sight Of the cold roofs where we must spend the night. Happy we had not been there, nor could be. Though we had tasted sleep and food and fellowship Together long.                             “How quick” to someone's lip The words came, “will the beaten horse run home.”   The word “home” raised a smile in us all three, And one repeated it, smiling just so That all knew what he meant and none would say. Between three counties far apart that lay We were divided and looked strangely each At the other, and we knew we were not friends But fellows in a union that ends With the necessity for it, as it ought.  Never a word was spoken, not a thought Was thought, of what the look meant with the word “Home” as we walked and watched the sunset blurred. And then to me the word, only the word, “Homesick,” as it were playfully occurred: No more. If I should ever more admit Than the mere word I could not endure it For a day longer: this captivity Must somehow come to an end, else I should be Another man, as often now I seem, Or this life be only an evil dream.

I was working in a bookstore and as an antidote to the twin torment of exhaustion and boredom, one day I went with a friend on a walking tour. We made it as far as Berlin and there I met the man I would move with to a boarding house, then to furnished rooms in the flat of a civil servant, and from there one morning in January to the Registry to be married. Afterward we moved to a studio apartment and two years later to the school where boys returning from the war would remove their collars and sew them back on with red thread to demonstrate the end of their allegiance to the cruel and fastidious past. Everyone wanted to be launched into a place from which you could look back and ask whether the red was also meant to enact spilled blood. You could say so, but only if you want to insist that history's minutia is best read as allegory. The fact is, history didn't exist then. Each day was a twenty-four hour stand-still on a bridge from which we discretely looked into the distance, hoping to catch sight of the future. It's near where you're standing now.

No foot may chase,No eye can follow, to a fatal placeThat power, that spirit, whether on the wingLike the strong wind, or sleeping like the windWithin its awful caves.—From year to yearSprings this indigenous produce far and near;No craft this subtle element can bind,Rising like water from the soil, to findIn every nook a lip that it may cheer.

their armies again, short years after

After love we smoke and sleep

There was another life of cool summer mornings, the dogwood air and the slag stink so gray like our monsoon which we loved for the rain and cool wind until the rot came into us. And I remember the boys we were the evening of our departure, our mothers waving through the train’s black pluming exhaust; they were not proud in their tears of our leaving, so don’t tell me to shut up about the war or I might pull something from my head, from my head, from my head that you wouldn’t want to see and whoever the people are might be offended.
From the green country you reconstruct in your brain, from the rubble and stink of your occupation, there is no moving out. A sweet boy who got drunk and brave on our long ride into the State draws a maze every day on white paper, precisely in his room of years as if you could walk into it. All day he draws and imagines his platoon will return from the burning river where he sent them sixteen years ago into fire. He can’t stop seeing the line of trees explode in white phosphorous blossoms and the liftship sent for them spinning uncontrollably beyond hope into the Citadel wall. Only his mother comes these days, drying the fruit in her apron or singing the cup of hot tea into his fingers which, like barbed wire, web the air.

First the people had to invent ladders. No one had ever seen a ladder. Once they had ladders they invented walls to climb over. Soon they realized it took two ladders to climb a wall. One to climb up one side—one to climb down the other. People would ascend one side of the wall, descend the other side of the wall, and then walk away, leaving the ladders behind. That is why there are so many ladders in the world. The ladders are picked up and stored in an enormous warehouse. Scientists have proposed attaching all the ladders, one on top of the other, creating an elevator into outer space. Some people want to destroy all the ladders. Others want to destroy the walls. Others say that someday we are going to need all the ladders in the world.

1.
Snow clouds shadow the bay, on the ice the odd fallen gull.
I try to keep my friend from dying by remembering
his childhood of praise to God, who needs us all. Würzburg:
the grownups are inside saying prayers for the dead,
the children are sent out to play—their laughter
more sacred than prayer. After dark his father
blesses and kisses him Güttenacht. He wakes
to go to school with children who stayed behind
and were murdered before promotion.
Now his wife lies beside him.
He may die with her head on his pillow.
He sings in his sleep:
“Her breasts are white sheep that appear on the mountain,
her belly is like a heap of wheat set about with lilies.”
Awake, he says, as if telling me a secret:
“When metaphor and reality come together, death occurs.”
His life is a light, fresh snow blowing across the bay.2.
A year later in Jerusalem, he carries a fallen soldier
on his back, himself. The text for the day begins:
“He slew a lion in the pit in a time of snow”
Seconds, minutes, hours are flesh,
he tells me he is being cut to pieces—
if they had not made him turn in his rifle …
He sees I can not bear more of that.
Yet a little sleep, a little slumber, a little folding
of hands in sleep and we drink to life.
Chilled in desert heat, what keeps him alive:
soldiers—his wife, his son and daughter,
perhaps the ashes of a girl he loved in childhood.
Outside their window
a Sun Bird and Dead Sea Sparrow fly
from everlasting to everlasting.
Later he covers my head with his hands, blessing me,
later unable to walk alone he holds onto my hand
with so much strength he comforts me.

into windows where every rivet bleeds
contrails of rust. An hour ago, the doctor’s wand
waved across my chest and I watched blood
on a small screen get back-sucked
into my weakened heart. It’s grown a hole
I have to monitor: one torn flap
shuddering an infinite ellipsis of gray stars
back and forth. You’re the writer, the doctor said
in French. Tell me what you see. Easier to stand
in a courtyard full of tourists scrying shapes
from this titanic Rorschach. Here’s a pump stub
shaped like a hand; something celled,
cavernously fluted as a lobster’s
abdomen. How much work
it must have taken to drag these bits
out of pits of flame, from lake beds
and rice paddies, and stack them in layers:
the French planes heaped beneath
the American ones, while the Englishwoman
beside me peers into this mess
of metals, trying to isolate one image
from the rest. Ski boot buckle
or tire pump, she muses at me, fossilized
shark’s jaw, clothespin, wasp’s nest?
According to the camera, it’s just a picture
changing with each angle, relic
turned to rib cage, chrome flesh
to animal: all the mortal details
enumerated, neutered. I watch her trace
an aluminum sheet torched across a thruster
as if wind had tossed a silk scarf
over a face. If she pulled it back, would I find
a body foreign as my own entombed
in here, a thousand dog tags
jangling in the dark? I tilt my head: the vision slides
once more past me, each plane reassembling
then breaking apart. Spikes of grief—
or is it fury?—throb across the surface.
Everything has a rip in it, a hole, a tear, the dim sounds
of something struggling to pry open
death’s cracked fuselage. White sparks,
iron trails. My heart rustles
in its manila folder. How the doctor smiled
at the images I fed him: A row of trees, I said,
pointing at my chart. Stone towers,a flock of backlit swallows—
                                                          Now I kneel beside a cross
of blades on which the Englishwoman
tries to focus. Do you think I’ll get itall in the shot? she calls as she steps back.
Steps back and back. Something like a knife sheath.
Something like a saint’s skull. The sky
floats past, horizon sucked into it. She won’t.

I dreamt that people from the Land of Chimes Arrived one autumn morning with their bells, To hoist them on the towers and citadels Of my own country, that the musical rhymes Rung by them into space at meted times Amid the market's daily stir and stress, And the night's empty star-lit silentness, Might solace souls of this and kindred climes. Then I awoke; and lo, before me stood The visioned ones, but pale and full of fear; From Bruges they came, and Antwerp, and Ostend, No carillons in their train.

BOOK I Deep in the shady sadness of a vale Far sunken from the healthy breath of morn, Far from the fiery noon, and eve's one star, Sat gray-hair'd Saturn, quiet as a stone, Still as the silence round about his lair; Forest on forest hung about his head Like cloud on cloud. No stir of air was there, Not so much life as on a summer's day Robs not one light seed from the feather'd grass, But where the dead leaf fell, there did it rest. A stream went voiceless by, still deadened more By reason of his fallen divinity Spreading a shade: the Naiad 'mid her reeds Press'd her cold finger closer to her lips.        Along the margin-sand large foot-marks went, No further than to where his feet had stray'd, And slept there since. Upon the sodden ground His old right hand lay nerveless, listless, dead, Unsceptred; and his realmless eyes were closed; While his bow'd head seem'd list'ning to the Earth, His ancient mother, for some comfort yet.        It seem'd no force could wake him from his place; But there came one, who with a kindred hand Touch'd his wide shoulders, after bending low With reverence, though to one who knew it not. She was a Goddess of the infant world; By her in stature the tall Amazon Had stood a pigmy's height; she would have ta'en Achilles by the hair and bent his neck; Or with a finger stay'd Ixion's wheel. Her face was large as that of Memphian sphinx, Pedestal'd haply in a palace court, When sages look'd to Egypt for their lore. But oh! how unlike marble was that face: How beautiful, if sorrow had not made Sorrow more beautiful than Beauty's self. There was a listening fear in her regard, As if calamity had but begun; As if the vanward clouds of evil days Had spent their malice, and the sullen rear Was with its stored thunder labouring up. One hand she press'd upon that aching spot Where beats the human heart, as if just there, Though an immortal, she felt cruel pain: The other upon Saturn's bended neck She laid, and to the level of his ear Leaning with parted lips, some words she spake In solemn tenour and deep organ tone: Some mourning words, which in our feeble tongue Would come in these like accents; O how frail To that large utterance of the early Gods! ""Saturn, look up!—though wherefore, poor old King? I have no comfort for thee, no not one: I cannot say, ""O wherefore sleepest thou?"" For heaven is parted from thee, and the earth Knows thee not, thus afflicted, for a God; And ocean too, with all its solemn noise, Has from thy sceptre pass'd; and all the air Is emptied of thine hoary majesty. Thy thunder, conscious of the new command, Rumbles reluctant o'er our fallen house; And thy sharp lightning in unpractis'd hands Scorches and burns our once serene domain. O aching time! O moments big as years! All as ye pass swell out the monstrous truth, And press it so upon our weary griefs That unbelief has not a space to breathe. Saturn, sleep on:—O thoughtless, why did I Thus violate thy slumbrous solitude? Why should I ope thy melancholy eyes? Saturn, sleep on! while at thy feet I weep.""        As when, upon a tranced summer-night, Those green-rob'd senators of mighty woods, Tall oaks, branch-charmed by the earnest stars, Dream, and so dream all night without a stir, Save from one gradual solitary gust Which comes upon the silence, and dies off, As if the ebbing air had but one wave; So came these words and went; the while in tears She touch'd her fair large forehead to the ground, Just where her falling hair might be outspread A soft and silken mat for Saturn's feet. One moon, with alteration slow, had shed Her silver seasons four upon the night, And still these two were postured motionless, Like natural sculpture in cathedral cavern; The frozen God still couchant on the earth, And the sad Goddess weeping at his feet: Until at length old Saturn lifted up His faded eyes, and saw his kingdom gone, And all the gloom and sorrow of the place, And that fair kneeling Goddess; and then spake, As with a palsied tongue, and while his beard Shook horrid with such aspen-malady: ""O tender spouse of gold Hyperion, Thea, I feel thee ere I see thy face; Look up, and let me see our doom in it; Look up, and tell me if this feeble shape Is Saturn's; tell me, if thou hear'st the voice Of Saturn; tell me, if this wrinkling brow, Naked and bare of its great diadem, Peers like the front of Saturn. Who had power To make me desolate? whence came the strength? How was it nurtur'd to such bursting forth, While Fate seem'd strangled in my nervous grasp? But it is so, and I am smother'd up, And buried from all godlike exercise Of influence benign on planets pale, Of admonitions to the winds and seas, Of peaceful sway above man's harvesting, And all those acts which Deity supreme Doth ease its heart of love in.—I am gone Away from my own bosom: I have left My strong identity, my real self, Somewhere between the throne, and where I sit Here on this spot of earth. Search, Thea, search! Open thine eyes eterne, and sphere them round Upon all space: space starr'd, and lorn of light; Space region'd with life-air; and barren void; Spaces of fire, and all the yawn of hell.— Search, Thea, search! and tell me, if thou seest A certain shape or shadow, making way With wings or chariot fierce to repossess A heaven he lost erewhile: it must—it must Be of ripe progress—Saturn must be King. Yes, there must be a golden victory; There must be Gods thrown down, and trumpets blown Of triumph calm, and hymns of festival Upon the gold clouds metropolitan, Voices of soft proclaim, and silver stir Of strings in hollow shells; and there shall be Beautiful things made new, for the surprise Of the sky-children; I will give command: Thea! Thea! Thea! where is Saturn?""        This passion lifted him upon his feet, And made his hands to struggle in the air, His Druid locks to shake and ooze with sweat, His eyes to fever out, his voice to cease. He stood, and heard not Thea's sobbing deep; A little time, and then again he snatch'd Utterance thus.—""But cannot I create? Cannot I form? Cannot I fashion forth Another world, another universe, To overbear and crumble this to nought? Where is another chaos? Where?""—That word Found way unto Olympus, and made quake The rebel three.—Thea was startled up, And in her bearing was a sort of hope, As thus she quick-voic'd spake, yet full of awe. ""This cheers our fallen house: come to our friends, O Saturn! come away, and give them heart; I know the covert, from thence came I hither."" Thus brief; then with beseeching eyes she went With backward footing through the shade a space: He follow'd, and she turn'd to lead the way Through aged boughs, that yielded like the mist Which eagles cleave upmounting from their nest.        Meanwhile in other realms big tears were shed, More sorrow like to this, and such like woe, Too huge for mortal tongue or pen of scribe: The Titans fierce, self-hid, or prison-bound, Groan'd for the old allegiance once more, And listen'd in sharp pain for Saturn's voice. But one of the whole mammoth-brood still kept His sov'reignty, and rule, and majesty;— Blazing Hyperion on his orbed fire Still sat, still snuff'd the incense, teeming up From man to the sun's God; yet unsecure: For as among us mortals omens drear Fright and perplex, so also shuddered he— Not at dog's howl, or gloom-bird's hated screech, Or the familiar visiting of one Upon the first toll of his passing bell, Or prophesyings of the midnight lamp; But horrors, portion'd to a giant nerve, Oft made Hyperion ache. His palace bright Bastion'd with pyramids of glowing gold, And touch'd with shade of bronzed obelisks, Glar'd a blood-red through all its thousand courts, Arches, and domes, and fiery galleries; And all its curtains of Aurorian clouds Flush'd angerly: while sometimes eagle's wings, Unseen before by Gods or wondering men, Darken'd the place; and neighing steeds were heard, Not heard before by Gods or wondering men. Also, when he would taste the spicy wreaths Of incense, breath'd aloft from sacred hills, Instead of sweets, his ample palate took Savour of poisonous brass and metal sick: And so, when harbour'd in the sleepy west, After the full completion of fair day,— For rest divine upon exalted couch And slumber in the arms of melody, He pac'd away the pleasant hours of ease With stride colossal, on from hall to hall; While far within each aisle and deep recess, His winged minions in close clusters stood, Amaz'd and full of fear; like anxious men Who on wide plains gather in panting troops, When earthquakes jar their battlements and towers. Even now, while Saturn, rous'd from icy trance, Went step for step with Thea through the woods, Hyperion, leaving twilight in the rear, Came slope upon the threshold of the west; Then, as was wont, his palace-door flew ope In smoothest silence, save what solemn tubes, Blown by the serious Zephyrs, gave of sweet And wandering sounds, slow-breathed melodies; And like a rose in vermeil tint and shape, In fragrance soft, and coolness to the eye, That inlet to severe magnificence Stood full blown, for the God to enter in.        He enter'd, but he enter'd full of wrath; His flaming robes stream'd out beyond his heels, And gave a roar, as if of earthly fire, That scar'd away the meek ethereal Hours And made their dove-wings tremble. On he flared, From stately nave to nave, from vault to vault, Through bowers of fragrant and enwreathed light, And diamond-paved lustrous long arcades, Until he reach'd the great main cupola; There standing fierce beneath, he stampt his foot, And from the basements deep to the high towers Jarr'd his own golden region; and before The quavering thunder thereupon had ceas'd, His voice leapt out, despite of godlike curb, To this result: ""O dreams of day and night! O monstrous forms! O effigies of pain! O spectres busy in a cold, cold gloom! O lank-ear'd Phantoms of black-weeded pools! Why do I know ye? why have I seen ye? why Is my eternal essence thus distraught To see and to behold these horrors new? Saturn is fallen, am I too to fall? Am I to leave this haven of my rest, This cradle of my glory, this soft clime, This calm luxuriance of blissful light, These crystalline pavilions, and pure fanes, Of all my lucent empire? It is left Deserted, void, nor any haunt of mine. The blaze, the splendour, and the symmetry, I cannot see—but darkness, death and darkness. Even here, into my centre of repose, The shady visions come to domineer, Insult, and blind, and stifle up my pomp.— Fall!—No, by Tellus and her briny robes! Over the fiery frontier of my realms I will advance a terrible right arm Shall scare that infant thunderer, rebel Jove, And bid old Saturn take his throne again.""— He spake, and ceas'd, the while a heavier threat Held struggle with his throat but came not forth; For as in the theatres of crowded men Hubbub increases more they call out ""Hush!"" So at Hyperion's words the Phantoms pale Bestirr'd themselves, thrice horrible and cold; And from the mirror'd level where he stood A mist arose, as from a scummy marsh. At this, through all his bulk an agony Crept gradual, from the feet unto the crown, Like a lithe serpent vast and muscular Making slow way, with head and neck convuls'd From over-strained might. Releas'd, he fled To the eastern gates, and full six dewy hours Before the dawn in season due should blush, He breath'd fierce breath against the sleepy portals, Clear'd them of heavy vapours, burst them wide Suddenly on the ocean's chilly streams. The planet orb of fire, whereon he rode Each day from east to west the heavens through, Spun round in sable curtaining of clouds; Nor therefore veiled quite, blindfold, and hid, But ever and anon the glancing spheres, Circles, and arcs, and broad-belting colure, Glow'd through, and wrought upon the muffling dark Sweet-shaped lightnings from the nadir deep Up to the zenith,—hieroglyphics old Which sages and keen-ey'd astrologers Then living on the earth, with labouring thought Won from the gaze of many centuries: Now lost, save what we find on remnants huge Of stone, or marble swart; their import gone, Their wisdom long since fled.—Two wings this orb Possess'd for glory, two fair argent wings, Ever exalted at the God's approach: And now, from forth the gloom their plumes immense Rose, one by one, till all outspreaded were; While still the dazzling globe maintain'd eclipse, Awaiting for Hyperion's command. Fain would he have commanded, fain took throne And bid the day begin, if but for change. He might not:—No, though a primeval God: The sacred seasons might not be disturb'd. Therefore the operations of the dawn Stay'd in their birth, even as here 'tis told. Those silver wings expanded sisterly, Eager to sail their orb; the porches wide Open'd upon the dusk demesnes of night; And the bright Titan, phrenzied with new woes, Unus'd to bend, by hard compulsion bent His spirit to the sorrow of the time; And all along a dismal rack of clouds, Upon the boundaries of day and night, He stretch'd himself in grief and radiance faint. There as he lay, the Heaven with its stars Look'd down on him with pity, and the voice Of Coelus, from the universal space, Thus whisper'd low and solemn in his ear. ""O brightest of my children dear, earth-born And sky-engendered, Son of Mysteries All unrevealed even to the powers Which met at thy creating; at whose joys And palpitations sweet, and pleasures soft, I, C{oe}lus, wonder, how they came and whence; And at the fruits thereof what shapes they be, Distinct, and visible; symbols divine, Manifestations of that beauteous life Diffus'd unseen throughout eternal space: Of these new-form'd art thou, oh brightest child! Of these, thy brethren and the Goddesses! There is sad feud among ye, and rebellion Of son against his sire. I saw him fall, I saw my first-born tumbled from his throne! To me his arms were spread, to me his voice Found way from forth the thunders round his head! Pale wox I, and in vapours hid my face Art thou, too, near such doom? vague fear there is: For I have seen my sons most unlike Gods. Divine ye were created, and divine In sad demeanour, solemn, undisturb'd, Unruffled, like high Gods, ye liv'd and ruled: Now I behold in you fear, hope, and wrath; Actions of rage and passion; even as I see them, on the mortal world beneath, In men who die.—This is the grief, O Son! Sad sign of ruin, sudden dismay, and fall! Yet do thou strive; as thou art capable, As thou canst move about, an evident God; And canst oppose to each malignant hour Ethereal presence:—I am but a voice; My life is but the life of winds and tides, No more than winds and tides can I avail:— But thou canst.—Be thou therefore in the van Of circumstance; yea, seize the arrow's barb Before the tense string murmur.—To the earth! For there thou wilt find Saturn and his woes. Meanwhile I will keep watch on thy bright sun, And of thy seasons be a careful nurse.""— Ere half this region-whisper had come down, Hyperion arose, and on the stars Lifted his curved lids, and kept them wide Until it ceas'd; and still he kept them wide: And still they were the same bright, patient stars. Then with a slow incline of his broad breast, Like to a diver in the pearly seas, Forward he stoop'd over the airy shore, And plung'd all noiseless into the deep night.
